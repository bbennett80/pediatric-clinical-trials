        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Unintended adolescent pregnancy is a major public health problem linked to pregnancy-induced hypertension, low birthweight, and prematurity. In addition, adolescent pregnancies cost an estimated $9.4 billion annually. Though declining, U.S. rates remain among the highest in the developed world. Highly effective methods exist, but adolescents face unique, multi-level barriers to contraceptive access and use. Thus, the vast majority of pregnancies are due to contraceptive non-use or incorrect use. Many, especially minority and uninsured youth, do not attend health maintenance visits; among those who do, seconds is spent discussing sexuality and contraceptive use is not routinely assessed. Multi-level interventions to increase access to contraceptive counseling and all contraceptive types are desperately needed.\n\nAs adolescent access to affordable, confidential contraceptive care has worsened in recent years, one approach to increase access is to utilize non-traditional settings, such as Emergency Departments (EDs). The Society for Academic Medicine recognizes the ED as an \"effective site for preventive care,\" evidenced by organizational conferences, consensus statements, and specialized training opportunities to reduce disparities stemming from social determinants of health. Adolescents make 19 million ED visits annually, commonly for non-urgent or reproductive complaints; for many, this may be their only contact with a provider. Adolescents in the ED frequently report unprotected intercourse. The pregnancy risk index (PRI), an estimate of pregnancy risk in the subsequent 12 months, for adolescent females in two EDs was more than three times greater than the national average. Lacking a primary provider was associated with higher PRI scores. While the need for reproductive care is evident, the majority of ED-based studies have focused on screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV and a few, primarily single-site studies have reported on acceptability of hypothetical reproductive care. Among the few addressing pregnancy prevention, most focused on emergency contraception or increasing clinic referral, with mixed results. A small open trial provided counseling and clinic referral for those wanting to initiate contraception. Only 22% completed the referral and one was found to be pregnant at her first clinic visit. Lack of transportation was the most common reason for not completing referral. Because interventions to address multi-level barriers and increase contraception access are sorely needed, the investigator aims to evaluate the feasibility of a novel ED-based intervention, utilizing a mixed methods approach.\n\nScientific Premise: Many adolescents in the ED are at high-risk of pregnancy yet accepting of reproductive intervention; however, no work describes best practices for ED-based contraceptive provision. Thus, the investigator proposes a randomized trial to evaluate MLI, which includes ED-based contraceptive initiation (i.e., oral pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection, or subdermal implant) vs. eSOC, for adolescents in two EDs utilizing APPs in a collaborative care model. Thus, the investigator will use a rigorous framework from Bowen et al. to evaluate feasibility constructs (see Table 1 for construct definitions) among adolescents and organizational personnel (i.e., study Advanced Practice Practitioners (APPs), adolescent medicine specialists, ED nursing and Reducing Adolescent Pregnancy in the Emergency Department leaders) in two unique EDs."

          "The purpose of this study is to develop biocompatible wireless electronic devices that will allow continuous, non-invasive hemodynamic and physiology measurements in the ICU."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Screening: All ICU patients will be screened by the study team based on inclusion and exclusion criteria through review of electronic medical records. For screening at Prentice Women's Hospital, screening criteria will be automatically applied through the use of the electronic data warehouse, and information from infants meeting this screening criteria will be transferred to the study team through electronic data warehouse. A screening and enrollment log will be kept to track ICU patients/parents who have been approached and agreed or declined to participate in the study. The screening and enrollment log will be kept on the Northwestern University housed REDCap server. Only the study team will have access to this log. All non-ICU participants will be screened through question and answer with a parent or guardian.\n\nDevice application: Standard devices will be used continuously in all subjects and this data compared to that collected using novel wearable sensors suggested in this study. In the ICU population, after patients are consented in the ICU, multiple wearable sensors (up to 5) will be placed on the patient for the duration of the study. Multiple devices are required to estimate BP. One or more devices will be placed on the chest or back, and one or more additional devices will be placed peripherally (e.g. leg, foot, arm, hand, head, or ear). Placing multiple devices will allow determination of which location provides the best signals in specific ICU populations. These devices will be placed using a medical grade skin adhesive similar to the ones used in the ICUs, which will minimize the risk of skin irritation or allergic reaction. Alternatively, the investigators are currently testing a \"soft wrap-around device\" (similar to that currently used for blood pressure monitoring in the premature babies) with a sensor. The soft wrap-around device is composed of hypoallergenic cotton. Overlying this cotton, and not touching the subject's skin, may include Coban wraps, paper tape, or a Velcro adhesion mechanism. Given the very small size of premature infants in the NICU, the investigators may incorporate this new technology as needed in the NICU. Each device is encapsulated in medical grade materials and applied using medical grade adhesive. The adhesives will be changed between uses. The device itself will be re-used. It will be cleaned with Super Sani-Cloth between each use. In the ICU population, devices will be left in place for up to 48 hours, but will be checked by study staff to ensure skin integrity and signal quality at least once every 24 hours. In the non-ICU population, standard of care devices will be attached to participants according to ICU standard of care procedures. The wearable sensors will be placed in the same manner as outlined above but will be left in place for only up to 3 hours during an outpatient study visit to the Center for autonomic Medicine in Pediatrics (CAMP).\n\nThe investigators have recently upgraded a new firmware version activating the ability for the sensor to continuously measure bioimpedance for respiratory rate. This function does not require any modification to the physical device itself or the adhesive. However, the bioimpedance functionality does require delivery of low amplitude sinusoidal current through the electrodes of the chest unit. The frequency of the current is 4 kHz - a frequency range used typically for human bioimpedance measurements by FDA cleared systems. The maximum current delivered is 8 μA. These parameters are below commonly used body fat percentage impedance analyzers that are widely commercially available. Furthermore, bioimpedance is standardly used in NICUs / PICUs leveraging the ECG electrodes that are then displayed on standard of care monitors. Commercially bioimpedance devices that are FDA approved inject currents that are 10x greater than our system (e.g. the CoVa Monitoring System 2 for continuous wearable sensing of thoracic impedance). Finally, the parameters in our sensor follow IEC 60601-1-2 guidelines for electromagnetic safety.\n\nVideo monitoring: In some participants, video monitoring of participant position and movement will be utilized during the study. This is an optional, additional part of the study in which families can choose to participate or not participate. If a family chooses to participate, a video camera will be utilized to capture participant movement and position for the duration of the study in the ICU or at CAMP.\n\nCuff-based blood pressure: While the wearable sensors are attached to participants in both the ICU and non-ICU populations, the participants will also be monitored with the normal standard of care monitoring montage. In addition, during one 3- or 4-hour period while the wearable sensors are attached to the patient, a member of the study team may take the participant's BP using the ICU standard cuff-based method every 15 minutes. Cuff-based measures typically happen every 15-60 minutes for standard clinical care, depending on the stability of the patient and physician discretion. In the ICU cohort, if a standard clinical cuff-based BP measure is taken during the 15-minute time epoch, the clinical measurements will be used rather than obtaining a separate research measurement. Outside of this 3- or 4-hour window and for the remainder of the study duration in the ICU population, cuff-based BP measures will be made only as frequently as needed for standard clinical care.\n\nSkin temperature: While the wearable sensors are attached to the participant, skin temperatures will be taken using a standard infrared thermometer. These measurements will be made at the same interval as the above cuff-based BP, over the same 3- or 4-hour period by a member of the study team. Outside of this 3- or 4-hour window, no skin temperature measures will be made for research purposes.\n\nDevice data: Wearable sensors can stream data continuously using near field communication (NFC) or Bluetooth technology. An encrypted laptop, iPad, or similar device will be left in the patient or CAMP study room and used to capture the continuous data stream from the wearable sensor. Additionally, wearable sensors can include onboard memory, and physiologic streams may be recorded to this onboard memory until transfer to an encrypted laptop for analysis.\n\nStandard of care data: In all participants where data from standard of care monitoring is captured and stored using the BedMasterEx system (all PICU and CCU beds, some NICU beds), these data will be used for comparison to data captured using EWP. In any participants where data are not captured and stored using the BedMasterEx system, video recordings will be made of the Phillips monitors using an encrypted mobile device. Within 48 hours, videos will be downloaded and transferred to a HIPAA secure server. In NICU patient without BedMasterEx data, the Somnostar system may be used to capture data for up to 4 hours of the study. All study data will be stored on an encrypted laptop and/or secure networkfor analysis.\n\nSkin integrity: Before and after wearable sensors are placed on the participant, the participant's skin integrity will be monitored using the ICU standard protocol, either the Braden Q scale (≥6 months of age) and/or Neonatal Skin Risk Assessment Scale (NSRAS; <6 months of age). Additionally, a member of the study team will use a validated skin integrity scale to score participants' skin condition at sensor placement site before sensor placement and immediately after sensor removal. At both of these time points, photographs will be taken of the participants' skin at the site of sensor placement to document any skin changes that occur during the period of wearable sensor wear. No faces will be photographed. Additional skin scores and photographs may be performed/taken between 30 minutes and 24 hours after sensor removal, as deemed necessary by the study and/or clinical team. The study team will consult the ICU bedside care team or CAMP clinical team within 1 hour for any concerning changes in skin integrity.\n\nQuestionnaires: After the study period ends, the parents will be approached to complete the questionnaires. These questionnaires will take less than 10 minutes to complete and are meant to assess opinions on use of these devices in the ICUs. These questionnaires will be completed using REDCap or a printed version of the REDCap questionnaire. All questionnaire data will be stored on the secure REDCap server housed by Northwestern University."

The success of the transplant, and thus long-term survival of the child, is well known to correlate with achieving adequate immunosuppression to prevent rejection, especially in the period immediately following transplant. Attaining adequate immunosuppression is complicated by several factors, many of which impact the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the immunosuppressive agent. These factors include age of the patient, renal and hepatic function, concomitant medications, patient genetics, and the time post-transplant. Frequent, invasive drug monitoring is used clinically to assess how these factors impact an individual child's PK, and in turn the dose required to achieve and maintain adequate immunosuppression. However, this empirical \"guess and check\" approach often results in the child spending substantial time receiving immunosuppressive therapy that is either ineffective or unsafe, decreasing the longevity of the transplant organ and thus, long-term patient survival. A more desirable approach would be to guide dosing using a precision medicine approach, wherein patient specific factors are used a priori to predict the dose most likely to achieve adequate immunosuppression. Developing a precision medicine platform for immunosuppression following pediatric heart transplant has the potential to not only improve outcomes in heart transplant recipients, but across all transplant types. This proposal aims to: 1) determine the impact of CYP3A5 genetic variation on tacrolimus concentrations in children, 2) prospectively validate the clinical utility of a PK-guided precision medicine platform in pediatric heart transplant patients receiving tacrolimus-based immunosuppression; and 3) identify and correlate biomarkers of transplant outcomes and tacrolimus safety/effect with the PK of tacrolimus, in order to establish the tacrolimus concentrations required for safe and effective immunosuppression in pediatric heart transplant recipients. The overall objective of this study is to improve the long-term survival of children with heart transplant via optimization of the child's immunosuppressive therapy. Importantly, the interdisciplinary nature of this mentored research proposal will facilitate my progress towards an independent career developing precision medicine tools to improve health outcomes in children."

The \"Promoting Resilience in Stress Management\" (PRISM) intervention is a manualized, brief, skills-based intervention delivered in 2, 45-60 minute one-on-one sessions, followed by a family meeting and supplemented by booster sessions and a digital app. PRISM was developed from Stress and Coping theory and targets skills in stress-management and mindfulness, goal-setting, positive reframing, and meaning-making. All of these skills are associated with improved patient outcomes in diverse groups of adolescent populations with chronic/serious illness, and findings from a feasibility trial in adolescents with T1D showed PRISM to be highly feasible and desirable in this population. Further, a recent pilot randomized controlled trial among adolescents with cancer suggest PRISM is associated with improved perceptions of resilience, lower psychological distress, and higher QOL. This application proposes to build on our prior experience and fill three critical knowledge gaps: (1) PRISM's impact on A1C among adolescents with T1D; and (2) PRISM's impact on diabetes distress, self-reported adherence, and other patient-reported outcomes including resilience and QOL. This funding opportunity seeks to test interventions targeting diabetes distress for impact on glycemic control. Thus, the investigators propose a multi-site randomized controlled trial among N=160 adolescents (n=80 PRISM, n=80 Usual Care; ages 13-18) with the primary trial outcome of glycemic control 6-months post-enrollment. Time-in-range will be evaluated for participants on continuous glucose monitors as an exploratory aim. Secondary outcomes will include diabetes-distress, and patient-reported adherence, resilience, and quality of life. The investigators hypothesize PRISM will promote better glycemic control and improved diabetes distress than usual care. This application offers an opportunity to expand the body of knowledge regarding methodologically rigorous and evidence-based interventions for adolescents with T1D. Ultimately, this research has the potential to offer a practical, skills-based curriculum designed to improve outcomes for this high-risk group."

          "The Juvenile Justice System (JJS) has not implemented any evidenced-based interventions that address suicidal behavior or nonsuicidal self-injury, hereafter referred collectively to as self-injury, with JJS-involved youth. This application proposes to test a scalable intervention, safety planning, that aims to reduce self-injury in adolescents involved in the JJS. Safety planning, which can be a stand-alone brief intervention, was cited as a best practice by the Suicide Prevention Resource Center/American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Best Practices Registry for Suicide Prevention. This study will have two phases. In Phase I, the investigators will conduct an open trial with 10 adolescents which will allow us to make any modifications necessary for using the protocol in a Probation Department. The investigators will then randomize 60 youth on Probation who screen positive for recent self-injury into standard care or the safety planning intervention. Counselors with community mental health experience embedded in Probation will conduct the intervention, consistent with the co-responder model found across JJS in the U.S. in which a Probation Officer works collaboratively with a mental health professional to coordinate care. In order to further conduct the study under conditions most relevant to a future implementation trial, the investigators will also employ a training approach that has been successfully implemented in a psychiatric hospital with Bachelors and Masters level staff. In Phase II, of the study, the investigators will: a) conduct qualitative interviews in Probation about attitudes toward the intervention as well as barriers to a future, larger implementation trial; and b) contract with the National Center for Mental Health and Juvenile Justice to conduct a Sequential Intercept Model (SIM) Mapping. The SIM is a conceptual framework to outline a series of \"points of interception\" along the JJS continuum in a state where screening and brief intervention may be implemented. In the Mapping, the investigators will examine the JJS continuum from arrest; to an initial hearing; to jail awaiting trial or adjudication; incarceration; to release or reentry; and finally, to community supervision. These data will provide a working framework to help assess current views within the statewide JJS as a starting point to proposing a future, larger trial. This research also has the potential to directly inform treatment practices in JJ settings and has significant implications for scalability and dissemination in order to build a stronger, more effective system of mental health/JJS collaboration around self-injury screening and intervention."

          "Background Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common condition requiring emergency surgery in children. The potential for morbidity and mortality from perforation of the appendix necessitates prompt diagnosis.2 Acute appendicitis scoring systems such as pediatric appendicitis score (PAS) use elements of history, exam findings, and lab tests to identify patients at high risk of having acute appendicitis.3 Despite having limited use for this intent 4,5 these scores are often used to stratify patients by risk for continued observation, imaging or operative care. 6 While CT scans may have higher diagnostic yield, its use is not without risk. CT- related radiation exposure has been shown to increase cancer risk. There have been US first strategies published by the American College of Radiology7 and the American College of Emergency Physicians.8 However, nearly 50% of appendix US examinations are equivocal, which poses a dilemma for EM physicians and results in variation in clinical care.\n\nVarious strategies exist for the diagnostic approach to the patient after equivocal US with symptoms of AA. While select patients may be safely discharged based on clinical judgment,9 emergency providers often obtain CT or admit patients for clinical observation. In a study conducted by Garcia et al., they concluded that a protocol of US followed by CT in children with negative or equivocal US exam results in beneficial management as well as cost savings.10 In a study by Gregory et al., they concluded that a clinical decision rule followed by staged imaging was found to be the most cost-effective approach for diagnosis of AA in children.11 Bachur et al. integrated PAS score with US findings and concluded that patients with high risk (PAS 7-10) but negative US or low risk (PAS 0-3) benefit from serial exam or further work up. 12 The addition of US to the strategy reduced CT utilization.11 Standardized radiology reports have also been shown to reduce CT scans and admissions for observation.13 At a network of institutions nationwide a tool called the pediatric appendicitis risk calculator (pARC)1 is being studied to assess patient's true risk of appendicitis and provide guidance for clinical management to ER physicians. Preliminary studies have found the pARC to be more accurate at predicting risk of appendicitis in children when compared to PAS score.\n\nThe study objective is to assess acute care charges and clinical outcomes among children with appendix US and pARC < 25%. To the investigator's knowledge, this is the first study to do so in a tertiary care pediatric hospital."

Focus groups or interviews with adolescents aged 14-18, combined with guidance from the mentorship team, will inform the adaptation and integration of evidence-based content. Focus groups or interviews will include discussion of integration of evidence-based content and attitudes towards substance use, SA, and SRB prevention.\n\nAim 2: Usability Testing of Integrated Prevention Program. Usability testing will include adolescents (n = 15-20) and physicians (n = 15-20) recruited from community-based primary care clinics and feedback will include reactions and obtain direct input from end users regarding design and content. Information obtained from this phase of development will be used to guide refinements of the tablet-based prevention program.\n\nAim 3: Pilot feasibility trial in preparation for RCT. Adolescents aged 14-18 will be recruited for screening from community-based primary care clinics to ensure ease of dissemination and representation of community-based primary care settings. The primary goal is to develop feasibility to apply for an R01 to conduct an RCT. Power analyses indicate that 280 participants would be needed for an RCT after accounting for attrition. Given that the RCT would be conducted over a 3-year period, a recruitment rate of 8 adolescents per month would indicate feasibility for a larger RCT. A secondary goal is to preliminarily examine outcomes."

          "The FBRI VTC Neuromotor Research Clinic was established and opened in May of 2013 to provide intensive therapeutic services to individuals with motor impairment secondary to neuromotor disorders. It is direct by Dr. Stephanie DeLuca and based on the principles surrounding ACQUIREc Therapy.\n\nACQUIREc Therapy is an evidenced-based approach to pediatric constraint-induced movement therapy, which refers to a multi-component form of therapy that is focused on helping children who have asymmetric motor abilities between the two sides of the body. Historically, ACQUIREc Therapy has the unimpaired or less impaired upper extremity constrained (by a cast or a splint) while also receiving active therapy from a specially trained therapist who shapes new skills and functional activities with the child's more impaired upper extremity but who is also a licensed Occupational or Physical Therapist (OT/PT). Therapy dosages are high much higher than tradition OT or PT - often lasting many hours per day, up to 6 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 2-4 weeks.\n\nInvestigators have developed further treatments based on the same principles of intensive services combined with behavior shaping for other areas of the body that are also affected by weakness (e.g., the leg and trunk) also, but which usually do not involve constraint. These have been more generally labeled ACQUIRE Therapy.\n\nAll forms involve intensive, play-based therapy for children with asymmetric motor impairments of the arms and hands. The primary focus of treatment is to facilitate the acquisition of new motor skills in the child's weaker body parts through high levels of intensive therapy using scientifically-based behavioral guidelines. Therapy is also delivered in naturalistic environments.\n\nACQUIREc Therapy as a treatment method has been tested in two randomized controlled trials, and a specific manual for its implementation has been developed. Dr. (s) Ramey and DeLuca previously founded a similar clinic, The Pediatric Neuromotor Research Clinic, at the University of Alabama at Birmingham where Dr. DeLuca directed the research clinic for 13 years and oversaw the implementation of the ACQUIREc Therapy treatment protocol in more than 400 cases.\n\nThis research will involve analyzing and interpreting the clinical data of children going through clinical procedures at the FBRI VTC Neuromotor Research Clinic. All participation is voluntary and no children will denied services if families choose not to participate."

          "This research study is a Pilot Study to determine whether using proton therapy in participants that require craniospinal radiation (whole brain and spinal cord radiation therapy) with sparing of the bony spine will work. This is the first time investigators are examining bone sparing proton therapy in pediatric craniospinal radiation.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved proton radiation for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are studying proton radiation in participants that require craniospinal radiation. The standard of care for this procedure is photon radiation, which is very similar to proton radiation. The investigators believe that the precision of proton radiation may help to reduce the negative effects radiation has on the surrounding non-cancerous growing and developing tissue"

        ],
        "EligibilityCriteria": [
          "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nEthnicity: This study is limited to Hispanics because of their higher risk of NAFLD, higher frequency (~50%) of the at-risk PNPLA3 allele (G), and because no prior studies have targeted improvement in liver fat and NAFLD in this high-risk population. As with all of our ongoing studies, Hispanic ethnicity will be based on self-identity for the participants as well as their parents and grandparents.\nGender: Males and females will be eligible for this study.\nAge: Children 12 to 18 years of age will be eligible. In our experience, children younger than around 10 years of age and greater than 18 years would require different intervention/counseling strategies. Therefore, we can develop a more consistent \"age-neutral\" approach if we limit the age range to 12-18 years.\nWeight status: Subjects will be eligible if they are obese, defined by a BMI > 95th percentile for age and gender.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nDiabetes: Presence of type 1 or 2 diabetes, as defined by fasting plasma glucose > 126 mg/dl, or positive for diabetes related antibodies including ICA512 and GAD. Participants testing positive for diabetes will be referred for treatment. Subjects with pre-diabetes will be eligible for the study\nPregnancy: Women who self-report as pregnant or obtain a positive pregnancy test result during Visit 1 will be excluded. Furthermore, should a woman become pregnant during the course of the intervention, she will be withdrawn from the study at that time and asked to no longer participate. This is in order to protect the mother and child from radiation involved with the DEXA scan and potential complications associated with a low-sugar diet.\nMedication: Taking any medications known to influence liver function, insulin action or lipid levels\nSelf-prescribed dietary supplements: Taking any non-prescription supplements that could potentially affect liver function and liver fat (eg vitamin E or fish oils)\nOther metabolic diseases: Diagnosis of other syndromes or diseases that may influence insulin action and secretion (e.g., maturity-onset diabetes of the young, lipoatrophic diabetes, cystic fibrosis), or body composition and fat distribution (e.g. Cushing syndrome, Down syndrome, lipodystrophy)\nOther medical condition: Previously diagnosed with any major illness since birth (e.g. severe intrauterine growth retardation, chronic birth asphyxia, cancer)\nFamilial hyperlipidemia: Patients with a family history of hyperlipidemia will be excluded, due to the particular genetic background of this disease, which may bias our results. Familial hyperlipidemia will be defined as LDL/cholesterol > 160 mg/dL and/or triglycerides > 200 mg/dL in both the participant AND at least one family member (first degree: parents or siblings).\nSmoking or drinking: Self-reported current smoking participants (more than 1 cigarette in the past week) will be excluded due to the potential effect of smoking on weight control and inflammatory status. Consumption of alcohol on a regular basis (40g/day alcohol per day determined by questionnaire) will also be excluded due to its important role in liver disease. Use of recreational drugs will also be an exclusion criteria, due to the potent effect of cannabinoids receptors on weight status and food intake.\nParticipation in a weight-loss or exercise program: participants who have participated to a weight-loss or exercise program in the past three months will be excluded due to its potential effect on weight status."

          "The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of dietary sugar reduction in obese children and examine whether there are differential effects based on genotype of a single amino acid substitution in the PNPLA3 gene that is highly prevalent in Hispanics and associated with significantly elevated liver fat."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "This dietary intervention aims at developing a more personalized and targeted treatment for NAFLD in Hispanic children and adolescents who are GG for the PNPLA3 variant. The investigators previous publications have shown that this particular demographic has a greater than 2-fold higher liver fat compared to GC and CC individuals. They have also demonstrated a significant gene*dietary sugar interaction with a significant association between liver fat and dietary sugar intake in GG subjects with no such association in GC or CC individuals. These studies suggests that different dietary strategies may have differential effects on reducing liver fat, depending on PNPLA3 genotype. To confirm this, the investigators will complete a clinical trial in 120 overweight and obese Hispanic children (12 - 18 years) with clinically verified NAFLD who will be randomized to one of two 12-week interventions:\n\nGroup 1 (standard of care control group): Dietary intervention focused on healthy eating (n=60; 30GG + 30GC/CC)\n\nGroup 2 (standard of care + sugar reduction): Dietary intervention based on healthy eating and sugar reduction focused on reduction of sugary beverages and added sugar towards a goal of 10% of daily calories (n=60; 30GG + 30GC/CC)\n\nThe following outcomes will be measured before and after intervention: Total liver fat fraction, and visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue volume by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); liver fibrosis by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE); total body fat by DEXA; liver enzymes, fasting insulin, glucose, lipids, free fatty acids and inflammatory markers, gut microbiome, and insulin and glucose response to an oral glucose challenge. The investigators hypothesize that liver fat fraction, liver fibrosis, and metabolic outcomes, such as fasting and 2h-glucose and insulin, and inflammatory biomarkers, will show significantly greater improvements with sugar reduction relative to control. In addition, the investigators also hypothesize a treatment*genotype interaction whereby the reduction in liver fat will be significantly greater in GG relative to CC/CG subjects."

This diagnosis will be confirmed by the investigators prior to enrollment of the subject and will be documented in the study documents. Subjects will be recruited during the scheduled work or research hours of the investigators in the ED.\n\nEligible patients will be informed of the study including a discussion of the two possible interventions. After informed consent and assent are obtained, patients will be randomly assigned 1 of the 2 arms of the study. The target is 40 subjects in each arm. Subjects will be assigned to a study group using a computer generated randomization schema. This randomization will only be known to one unblinded collaborator that will not be enrolling subjects or be involved in the data analysis.\n\nIf assigned to receive intravenous migraine medications the subject will be treated with the standard of care medications which include ketorolac (0.5mg/kg, max 30mg), metoclopramide (0.1 mg/kg, max 10mg), diphenhydramine (1mg/kg, max 50mg) plus a normal saline fluid bolus (20mL/kg, max 1000mL).\n\nIf assigned to the auricular acupuncture arm, efficacious ear points will be located by a needle contact test and/or an electrical point finder which emits an acoustic alarm when a change in electrical resistance is detected signifying a potential active auricular acupoint. If the subject does not improve with acupuncture, they will be assessed by the ED physician and at the MD discretion further emergency department treatment will be administered which may include intravenous migraine medications as this is the current standard of care in the Norton Children's Hospital/Norton Children's Medical Center (KCH/KCMC) ED.\n\nAll subjects will be contacted 2 to 6 days after discharge to determine their clinical status. If the darts are still in place at the follow-up call, the subjects will be contacted at 2 weeks and weekly thereafter until all darts have fallen out."

Following the 5-day baseline decolonization regimen, households will be randomized to one of three intervention groups: 1) Periodic personal decolonization performed by all household members, to include chlorhexidine body washes twice weekly for 3 months and application of intranasal mupirocin for 5 consecutive days each month for 3 months; 2) Household environmental hygiene, including targeted cleaning of household surfaces and laundering of bed linens, weekly for 3 months; and 3) Integrated periodic personal decolonization and household environmental hygiene for 3 months. Households will be followed prospectively (1, 3, 6, and 9 months following randomization) to measure the prevalence of S. aureus colonization in the participants, household environmental surfaces, and pet dogs and cats and to document the incidence of recurrent SSTI. Molecular strain typing will be performed on all recovered S. aureus isolates to illuminate transmission dynamics and the effects of the decolonization measures on genetic epidemiology. Lastly, the investigators will assess resistance to the prescribed topical antimicrobials at baseline and longitudinal samplings."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Multidisciplinary experts from two Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) used an iterative modified Delphi process to develop and refine criteria for determining PICU patients for whom a family care conference would be beneficial. A preliminary set of criteria were developed with expert input and review of the literature. The investigators then assessed the preliminary criteria by retrospectively reviewing PICU patient's medical records at the two participating sites. Making revisions as needed the investigators then assessed the reliability of the family care conference criteria by prospectively reviewing the medical records of two months of PICU patient admissions at both participating sites. Based on these efforts, the investigators have described a set of family care conference criteria that will be studied in this investigation.\n\nPrimary Aim: Assess the inclusivity of the developed Family care conference criteria (FCC).\n\nSecondary Aim: Describe parents' views of PICU family care conferences (FCC) and factors associated with having PICU family care conferences.\n\nMethods: Taking an implementation science approach, the investigators will use plan-do-study-act cycles to optimize the goal of offering an FCC to all parent(s) of patients with any FCC criteria. The implementation aim statement is, within 6 months, healthcare team members will offer an FCC to the parent(s) of >95% of patients who have at least one FCC criteria.\n\nPlanning (Plan). Development teams at participating institutions have determined how to inform PICU healthcare team members (HTMs) when a patient has an FCC criterion. A one-page information sheet (written at a 6th-grade level) describing FCCs, their potential role and value will be used when offering families a FCC. The development teams have also created an electronic health record (EHR) note template to document offering and conducting FCCs.\nImplementation (Do). Each weekday, a study team member at each site will review the EHR to identify patients who have one FCC criteria. A study team member will inform the PICU team when a patient has at least one FCC criteria and request that an HTM give the parent(s) the FCC information sheet, offer the parent(s) an FCC, and document the conversation with the parent(s) in the EHR. The processes for organizing and conducting FCCs will occur according to the PICU teams' discretion.\nData collection (Study). The investigators will track the occurrence of FCCs by reviewing the EHR and obtaining input from PICU HTMs. For patients meeting at least one FCC criteria, but for whom an FCC was not documented, a study team member will ask the patient's PICU team (either resident, fellow, APRN, or attending) if an FCC occurred while the patient was admitted. For patients meeting FCC criteria, but for whom an FCC did not occur, study team members will also document if an FCC was offered by reviewing the EHR. If there is no EHR documentation about offering parent(s) an FCC, a study team member will ask the patient's PICU team (within a week of informing them that a patient met an FCC criteria) if the parent(s) were offered an FCC and if not why the parent(s) were not offered and FCC. Using input from HTMs, the investigators will record reasons for not offering an FCC and ascertain why parents opted out of an FCC. In addition to data about the FCC criteria, the investigators will extract the follow patient data from the EHR: age; sex; Pediatric Index of Mortality 3 (PIM3) score (measures of PICU admission illness severity) indication for PICU admission; need for intubation; need for pressors/vasoactive medications; number of subspecialty teams consulted; and use of ECMO.\nRevise implementation plan (Act). The development teams will meet every other week x 4, then monthly x 4, then every two months to review the data, assess implementation, and modify the process as needed.\n\nTo describe parents' views of PICU FCCs and factors associated with having PICU FCCs, the investigators will enroll English- and Spanish-speaking (materials will be available in Spanish) parents (one or both) of PICU patients <18 years old for whom an FCC occurred or whose child had at least one FCC criteria. English- and Spanish-speaking parents (one or both) of PICU patients < 18 years old whose child did not have an FCC criteria and who did not have an FCC will also be eligible until the investigators have enrolled 100 parents. the investigators will invite eligible parents to complete a post-FCC Survey within three days of an FCC (for those that have an FCC). The investigators will invite all eligible parents to complete a post-PICU Survey and participate in a one-on-one interview within three days of PICU discharge.\n\nThe Post-FCC Survey will ask for information about parent characteristics and feedback on the FCC. The variables related to parent characteristics will include demographics, family relationship style (using the Family Apgar), informational support (using the Informational Support SF4a), and mental health (using the two-item PROMIS® mental health scale) and global physical health (using the two-item PROMIS® global physical health scale). Items asking for feedback about the FCC (adapted from previous work) will assess: overall FCC utility; the topics discussed and their importance to the parents; what was useful and what could be improved; and whether the parent would like to have another FCC in the future. The post-PICU Survey will include the same items asking about family characteristics as in the Post-FCC Survey (not included for parents who completed a post-FCC Survey). The post-PICU Survey will also include items asking about the utility of other modes of PICU communication (daily rounds, electronic patient portals, written information, bedside and phone interactions with physicians/APRNs and bedside nurses, and communication with social workers, chaplains, and case managers). Finally, the post-PICU Survey will ask if an FCC was offered, request feedback on FCCs (see above) that occurred (not included if a post-FCC Survey was completed), and ask why offered FCCs did not occur. All non-validated survey items were reviewed by the study team, for face validity. Parents of patients who die in the PICU will receive the post-PICU Survey by mail or email 3-5 weeks after their child's death, as the investigators and others have done previously. Parents will complete surveys electronically on a tablet using REDCap. Audio-recorded one-on-one interviews will be conducted by a study team member using an interview guide that focuses on the following content areas: perceptions of PICU communications overall; specific modes of communication; why an FCC occurred or did not occur; and perceptions of FCC utility."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Sickle cell disease (SCD) and cancer are medical conditions in youth that are associated with psychosocial problems including anxiety and depressive symptoms and impaired health-related quality of life. Both SCD and cancer can require a number of treatments and hospitalizations, which negatively impact family relationships, peer functioning, and other life domains. In addition, both conditions and treatments can involve a range of symptoms or side effects (e.g., pain, fatigue, nausea) that interfere with daily life. In other words, patients with SCD and cancer are responsible for gradually learning to manage and live with challenges associated with their medical condition. As such, recent efforts focus on providing psychological interventions to support self-management as an adjunct to standard medical care.\n\nChildren and adolescents with SCD and cancer may have limited access to skilled psychologists or may not be able to attend frequent in-person intervention visits to acquire skills to support psychosocial functioning. A critical barrier to helping adolescents with SCD and cancer is that there are few portable interventions that provide assistance outside of the hospital environment.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to pilot test FOCUS (Framing Opportunities and Challenges Using Stories), an innovative and portable intervention designed to improve the psychosocial functioning of adolescents with medical conditions. The intervention involves taking and captioning purposeful photographs that align with The Hero's Journey, a guiding narrative template that chronicles a hero's passage through life's adventures and challenges, culminating in individual strength and transformation (Campbell, 1968). Preliminary data evaluating components of FOCUS revealed significant improvements in mood among healthy adolescents and young adults. Data suggest that reflecting on positive and negative daily events (e.g., via a photograph) and writing about the experiences have profound positive effects on a range of outcomes (e.g., grit, gratitude, functioning). In addition, the investigators intend to share the participants' photographs, stories, and advice on a website for other adolescents with SCD or cancer. Data indicate that prosocial behavior (e.g., providing advice to peers) and social connectedness have a number of positive outcomes. The central prediction is that FOCUS will be acceptable and feasible to deliver and that pilot data will reveal improvements in participants' psychosocial health. Achieving these aims will provide the foundational data needed for federal grant applications to evaluate FOCUS with a larger pediatric sample and other patient populations, powered to identify outcomes and mechanisms of change.\n\nAim. Pilot FOCUS. A pilot randomized controlled trial will compare FOCUS to standard care. Investigators will randomize a total of 60 12- to 18-year-old patients to either FOCUS intervention (n=15 with SCD; n=15 with cancer) or treatment as usual (n=15 with SCD; n=15 with cancer). Randomization will be stratified to match patients based on age, sex, and medical condition (SCD type, cancer type). FOCUS participants will engage in the intervention and complete measures for 10 days post hospital discharge. Control participants will complete similar measures but not receive the intervention. Mixed qualitative and quantitative measures of feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes will be conducted to evaluate both the intervention and study procedures."

          "Completing evidence-based treatments for depression has been shown to be particularly problematic for Black adolescents. Their rates of participation in treatments for depression are lower due to negative perceptions of services and providers, and their reluctance to acknowledge the presence of symptoms.\n\nIf Black adolescents' depression treatment needs are to be met, the engagement challenges and the factors that lessen the success of treatment in the \"real world\" must be addressed. This research examines the effectiveness of the Making Connections Intervention (MCI) and investigates key mediators of both engagement and response to treatment for depression.

The study also uses tailored outreach strategies for adolescents and parents by including innovative digital content such as a web page/app along with other digital products.\n\nThe investigators previously performed a small pilot study that used the MCI as an add-on to the IPT-A, an evidence-based intervention for depression delivered in schools typically over 12 sessions. The results suggested that MCI has a positive impact on many aspects of change associated with treatment engagement and clinical outcomes.\n\nThis study will be a randomized controlled trial. It will examine the effectiveness of the MCI in a multi-school trial involving adolescents in grades 6-12 who attend New York City (NYC) Department of Education (DOE) Public Schools. The investigators will randomly assign 60 Black students with depression symptoms to two conditions: MCI+IPT-A vs. IPT-A-alone. The investigators will also do qualitative research, like interviews, before the digital content is created. This will enhance the relevance of the MCI. The main outcomes are adolescent-and caregiver-level engagement and adolescent depression. Suicidal ideation is a secondary outcome. This study will also test related factors, like adolescent helping-seeking behavior and parental knowledge of mental health services, that can account for treatment outcomes and that will allow the MCI to be strengthened in future roll-outs of the intervention in school settings."

In fact, using zosyn (piperacillin-tazobactam) as a single-drug therapy, there are additional benefits of simplicity, compliance, and lower infectious complications. Currently surgeons are already using both 2-drug regimen (ceftriaxone/metronidazole) and single-drug regimen (zosyn) interchangeable as both are FDA approved and regulated antibiotics for intra-abdominal infection.

Results from the study will provide specific direction for what components should comprise future decision-making interventions for adolescents with overweight/obesity."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Adolescent overweight and obesity (AOB; i.e., a body mass index (BMI) greater than 85th percentile for age, height, and gender) affects 34.5% of adolescents. Over 80% of obese adolescents will become obese adults and experience increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, gallbladder disease, and some forms of cancer. Because of contraindications and hesitations to pursue psychopharmacology or bariatric surgery, behavioral interventions are the first-line treatment for AOB. Unfortunately, adolescent outcomes from pediatric behavioral obesity treatments are poor. In fact, the modal weight loss in behavioral interventions is less than a single BMI point, and many participants lose no weight at all. Outcomes in adolescents are worse than those found in younger children and adults. Notably, the vast majority of existing interventions tested in adolescents are designed for younger children, which may preclude an adolescent's success in these interventions. Successful behavioral AOB interventions may require augmentations that address developmental concerns unique to adolescence. For example, research has shown that, in contrast to younger children, many adolescents are making their own food decisions and are thus more likely to engage in problematic eating behaviors during treatment. As a necessary step towards developing specialized interventions for AOB, it is critical to understand the underlying mechanisms of continued engagement in problematic eating behaviors during AOB interventions.\n\nThree types of problematic eating behaviors are strongly linked (cross-sectionally and longitudinally) with AOB. First, reward-driven overeating (i.e., frequently eating energy-dense foods) results in excess calorie intake, which, in turn, produces adiposity during childhood and adolescence. Second, loss-of-control eating (LOC; the experience of not being able to stop eating once started) is an exceptionally strong predictor of excess weight gain, i.e., an additional 2.4kg per year compared to peers without LOC. Third, rigid dietary restriction involves skipping meals and cutting out food groups for the purposes of weight regulation, but instead results in intense feelings of deprivation. As a result, rigid dietary restriction has the paradoxical effect of calorie overconsumption, excess weight gain, and poor outcomes from pediatric obesity treatment. Taken together, findings indicate that elucidating the drivers of these three problematic eating behaviors is critical to improving AOB treatment outcomes.\n\nAn aberrant decision-making framework represents an attractive paradigm for understanding the above-described problematic eating behaviors, especially given that they all run counter to adolescents' intentions and well-being. There are several aberrant decision-making processes endemic to the adolescent developmental period. Three of these processes in particular appear to be directly linked to the three problematic eating behaviors described above. To the extent that aberrant decision-making produces problematic eating behavior, aberrant decision-making can also be hypothesized to predict poor weight loss outcomes. Below, three aberrant decision-making processes and their links to problematic eating behavior are described.\n\nIncreased delay discounting. Delay discounting refers to the tendency to discount greater, later rewards in favor of smaller, sooner rewards. A combination of greater sensitivity to reward and slow development of self-regulatory neural processes contributes to especially high discounting rates in some adolescents. Relatively higher discounting rates may produce reward-driven eating, i.e., frequent consumption of energy-dense foods (e.g., high-fat, high sugar foods), while discounting the future reward (e.g., weight loss) that would be derived from forgoing immediate gratification. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis concluded that higher discounting rates were strongly cross-sectionally linked with AOB. Although behavioral weight loss programs discourage consumption of energy-dense foods, psychological strategies for how to prioritize long-term over short-term rewards are not provided. Thus, delay discounting likely contributes to continued reward-driven eating during treatment. However, no studies have tested whether delay discounting predicts reward-driven overeating (and its effect on weight) during AOB treatment.\n\nAffect-driven impulsivity. Affect-driven impulsivity refers to a tendency to choose maladaptive behaviors geared towards the immediate cessation of a negative affective state, despite negative consequences. Affect-driven impulsivity likely drives continued LOC eating during treatment, precluding successful weight loss. Affect-driven impulsivity is a cross-sectional predictor of AOB, but it may be a particularly strong driver of LOC eating because compulsive eating serves the function of reducing distress. Although no studies have compared adolescents with and without LOC on affect-driven impulsivity, adolescents with LOC eating demonstrate overall higher levels of emotional reactivity and emotional eating. LOC eating resulting from affect-driven impulsivity may continue to occur during treatment because little treatment content focuses on skills for tolerating negative affect. Dr. Manasse's work demonstrates that increased affect-driven impulsivity predicts poor outcomes from adult binge eating treatment. However, no studies have examined whether affect-driven impulsivity predicts (1) engagement in LOC during treatment or (2) poor AOB treatment outcomes.\n\nPerseverative decision-making. Perseverative decision-making is characterized by weakened ability to stop engagement in habitual behaviors despite changing contingencies. Highly perseverative decision-making may contribute to repeated engagement in rigid dietary restriction (i.e., setting rigid calorie goals, cutting out specific foods) that increase deprivation. This deprivation, in turn, leads to episodes of overeating that preclude successful caloric restriction. Those who show highly perseverative decision-making continue engaging in this rigid dietary restriction behavior despite the fact that it ultimately delivers the opposite of its intended effect. Indeed, perseverative decision-making and rigid dieting are associated with the presence of LOC eating, and perseveration is cross-sectionally associated with obesity in adolescence. Despite the established links between perseverative decision-making with unhealthy dieting and excess weight, no studies have examined whether perseverative decision-making underlies continued engagement in problematic dietary restriction during treatment and predicts poor outcomes.\n\nTo inform the development of tailored intervention approaches, the current study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, aims to elucidate the specific aberrant decision-making processes associated with three problematic eating behaviors and weight loss outcomes. Results from the study will provide specific direction for what components (e.g., strategies for tolerating emotional distress or promoting flexible thinking) should comprise a future decision-making intervention for AOB and for whom (e.g., those with LOC, those who engage in problematic restriction) certain components would be most relevant. Given that LOC eating is a robust predictor of excess weight gain but only 20-30% of those with AOB endorse LOC eating, the study team will oversample individuals with clinically significant LOC, i.e., the study will recruit a total of 80 adolescents (ages 14-18) with overweight/obesity, half of whom (n=40) endorse clinically significant (i.e., at least once weekly) LOC eating and the other half of whom (n=40) endorse subclinical LOC or no LOC. All participants will receive a 16-week group-based, remotely delivered behavioral weight loss intervention and complete a 6-month follow-up. Decision-making measures will be administered at baseline. Problematic eating behaviors and weight will be assessed at all time points."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "The post-operative ICU course for children receiving liver transplants and TPIAT (total pancreatectomy with islet cell autotransplantation) includes a number of different challenges, one of which includes pain. Pain is treated with both medications and approaches without medications (such as music and other distraction techniques). Opioids are one such effective pain medication which is universally used, however like all medications has risks of certain side effects (such as nausea, constipation, itching, and others). Modern research has searched for other medications and methods to treat pain in both children and adults. In this study, the investigators aim to apply one of these methods that has been shown to be effective in certain operative populations through a medicine called Magnesium-Sulfate, which may be a safe way to decrease the use of other pain medications (specifically opioids). Magnesium is already a physiologic electrolyte the body uses, which are consumed from certain foods. Used as an IV medication to reach higher levels of magnesium can work to decrease pain via its action on specific nerve receptors. Magnesium-Sulfate will be given at the beginning of transplant surgery for consented liver and TPIAT transplant patients, and continue an infusion for 48 hours into their ICU course. The investigators will monitor side effects and treat pain the same way otherwise the care team would without magnesium to determine whether there is any beneficial effect that can be applied to children in the future."

        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "There is limited data relating head impact biomechanics to neurological outcomes in humans. Concussion occurs from rotational loading of the head giving rise to diffuse stresses and strains in the brain tissue leading to autonomic and physiological dysfunction. Repeated head loading is common in contact sports and an integral part of soccer. It is unknown whether the same biomechanical forces from lower severity head impacts such as typical soccer heading cause temporary physiological deficits as well. Advancement of objective physiological function assessment devices allow measurement of neurological effects in the absence of diagnosed concussion. Recent soccer heading studies have evaluated neurophysiological changes pre- and post-repetitive heading. These studies have found conflicting results for the effect on neurocognitive performance immediately following a bout of heading, but consistent changes were observed in measures of vestibular balance, ocular function, and neurochemical biomarkers.\n\nSoccer heading biomechanics studies showed that females experienced higher severity head loading, and in equivalent sports such as soccer and basketball, females have higher concussion rates. This study will compare the physiological changes of male and female adolescents completing one of two soccer heading paradigms to those randomized to kicking to evaluate the effect of repetitive head impacts. This study will relate biomechanical measures of head loading with physiological function changes associated with repeated head impacts, and compare sex-differences in biomechanical measures and physiological changes."

          "Anorectal manometry requires that the patient be able to respond to command and not receive any medications which could alter muscle tone or motility. In the pediatric population, anorectal manometry can be psychologically challenging to parents and their child, as it is traditionally performed without adjuvant sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives and anesthesia can alter motility and smooth muscle activity, as well as render it difficult or impossible for the child to follow commands required of the study. Patient or parent non-compliance, inability to follow commands or to tolerate the procedure often renders the study invalid or impossible to complete. Dexmedetomidine is a sedative who's effect on anorectal musculature has not been studied nor determined. It would be important to determine whether it spares smooth muscle function, as it would provide a viable option to provide sedation to children while still preserving their ability to respond to command. The primary objective of this study is to examine the effects of dexmedetomidine on gastrointestinal smooth muscle by observing changes in anorectal manometry before and after dexmedetomdine administration."

          "Primary objective:\n\nTo examine the effects of dexmedetomidine on intra-anal pressure and the dose response curve to balloon distention by comparing the baseline measurements with those after dexmedetomidine administration.\n\nDexmedetomidine is an alpha-2 agonist that is considered to be a smooth muscle relaxant. It's a potential use as a sedative for endoscopies has been considered. It is important to know whether or not it has effect on smooth muscle tone and would affect manometry studies in those patients who could receive it. The investigator hypothesizes that dexmedetomidine will have minimal effects in the dosing that is being administered.\n\nBackground:\n\nAnorectal manometry requires that the patient be able to respond to command and not receive any medications which could alter muscle tone or motility. These patients typically have the manometry performed without any adjuvant sedatives, anesthetics or medications. In the pediatric population, anorectal manometry can be psychologically challenging to parents and their child, particularly without adjuvant sedation or anesthesia. There are some exceptional circumstances which require sedation/anesthesia administration for these procedures, either because the children are young (< 5 years), they have behavioral issues (like autism) or because they have severe anxiety. In those patients with severe issues even general anesthesia may be needed. The risk of administering any medication to these patients is that they can alter motility and smooth muscle activity, consequently artificially altering the results of the anal manometry. It is important to know which medications can be administered without affecting anal muscle tone. Dexmedetomidine is a newer sedative and anxiolytic. It could be valuable for anxiolysis for anal manometry. It's effect on anal smooth muscle, however, has never been studied. It would be important to determine whether it spares smooth muscle function, as it would provide a viable option to provide sedation to children while still preserving their ability to respond to command.\n\nDexmedetomidine is one of the standard drugs administered for sedation in children who require sedation for diagnostic (gastroendoscopic upper and lower procedures) and radiologic diagnostic imaging studies (MRI, CT and Nuclear Medicine). Over 17,000 infants, children and developmentally compromised young adults have been sedated with dexmedetomidine at Boston Children's Hospital without a cardiac or respiratory arrest, or a need to provide positive pressure assisted ventilation.\n\nMethods:\n\nPatients will undergo the usual anal manometry study, with no adjuvant medications, per routine practice currently in the gastrointestinal unit. Following completion of manometry, 0.5 mcg/kg DEX will be administered over 1 minute followed by an infusion of 0.15 mcg/kg/hr. Manometry measurements will be followed for 15 minutes in response to DEX.\n\nDefinition of Primary Endpoint:\n\nPrimary outcome: To examine the effects of dexmedetomidine on intra-anal pressure and the dose response curve to balloon distention by comparing the baseline measurements with those after dexmedetomidine administration. The pressure measurements will be recorded by the research team member who will be present, every 30 seconds starting from 5 minutes prior to DEX to 15 minutes following DEX administration.\n\nData Analysis Plan:\n\nData will be analyzed after the completion of the study. The manometry measurements will be done blindly by one of the investigators.\n\nThe following endpoints will be analyzed at the completion of the study: time to meet modified Aldrete discharge criteria, adverse events, need for unplanned airway interventions, intravenous anesthetic duration of sedation, presence of agitation/delirium (PAED score), and time of BIS score to return to baseline (pre-sedation level).\n\nStatistical Power and Sample Considerations:\n\nThe study was powered and sample size calculated assuming a mean intra-anal pressure of 90 mmHg, with a mean reduction to 65 mmHg, and a standard deviation of 32. With a significance level of 0.05, it would require approximately 15 subjects to achieve power of 80.3%."

          "Despite increasing suicide rates in adolescents, there remains a paucity of approaches to use to prevent re-attempts. Any hope for breaking the code to prevent youth suicide lies in understanding biological factors that play a role. Evidence suggests that inflammation and immune system dysfunction may be linked to suicide. The investigators will develop immune profiles for adolescents with suicidal behavior and those at risk in order to develop tools that can be implemented for prevention efforts.\n\nThis study involves blood draws, answering questions, and completing questionnaires - no treatment or intervention is provided as part of this study. Participants will be screened to see if they qualify for this study using questionnaires.\n\nParticipants will be teens (ages 12-18 years) with recent suicidal behavior, teens at-risk for developing depression, and healthy control teens. Participants complete all study-related tasks four times over a period of 12 months. Electronic surveys will be sent to participants to complete monthly. Both the adolescent and if applicable, their parent (or legally authorized representatives, LARs), will answer questions regarding depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts/behaviors."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "The purpose of this study is to map inflammatory dysfunction to suicidal behavior and establish a reliable immune signature of suicide risk that can 1) guide future research into fundamental pathophysiology and 2) identify targets for drug development and guide clinical screening and risk management.\n\nBackground: In previous research, the investigators have identified targets of clinical utility for both suicide-risk identification and novel therapeutic development. Specifically, a state of immune hyper-reactivity that predisposes to suicidal behavior can be corrected by use of immunomodulatory agents.\n\nBlood tests screening for presence of autoantibodies may be implemented as diagnostic tests to predict future suicide risk. Monoclonal antibodies have gained recent attention for their use in CNS disorders (such as multiple sclerosis and migraine) and have been shown to be effective for some patients with depression.\n\nHowever, the utility of anti-inflammatory treatments for depression has been limited by a lack of biomarkers to guide their use. Thus, presence of autoantibodies may identify a sub-group of adolescents and young adults with suicidality who are candidates for treatment with monoclonal antibodies.\n\nThe investigators specifically hypothesize that depressed youths with suicide behavior have immune hyper-reactivity, as reflected in dysfunctional cells mediating both innate and adaptive immune response.\n\nStudy Items: Since this is an observational study, investigators will explore a comprehensive panel of carefully selected participant specific parameters: socio-demographic (age, ethnicity, economic); symptom severity measures (depressive symptoms, mood, and feelings); clinical (medical history, anxious depression, early life trauma), biological (biomarkers in blood), behavioral (cognitive, emotional), with the goal to develop the most robust predictive models of treatment response and of depression outcomes.

          "The current study will examine the efficacy of a virtual reality (VR) intervention entitled \"IMPRoving Expression of Skills and Strengths In Interviewing in a Virtual Environment\" (IMPRESSIVE) which targets social competency skills needed for successful job interviewing. Specifically, 2 VR tools are utilized in the IMPRESSIVE intervention. The first tool is VR-Job Interview Training (VR-JIT), a VR program which offers the opportunity for repeated practice with a virtual human interviewer. Preliminary evidence suggests that the VR-JIT is successful in adults with ASD1 and schizophrenia14 in improving interview abilities. However, the efficacy of VR-JIT has not been evaluated in adolescents with ASD. This represents a significant void in our knowledge, as we do not know whether this program is effective for youth. In addition to VR-JIT, a newly developed VR tool is included in the currently proposed intervention: the Kessler Foundation STRength IDentification and Expression tool (VR-STRIDE). KF-STRIDE is focused on improving the ability to express personal strengths during the job interview, a skill that is not taught with VR-JIT. The proposed IMPRESSIVE intervention, which combines the learning of 2 critical abilities (social skills and strength identification), has never been examined in individuals with ASD. Thus, the current proposal will be the first to examine the efficacy of these 2 combined tools in this at-risk population."

          "This longitudinal prospective cohort study is recruiting children and adolescents aged 7-18 years with newly diagnosed primary hypertension over a 2-year period from the Hypertension Clinic at Brenner Children's Hospital, which sees over 300 new patients per year, who will be treated with the first-line drug lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, per standard of care (Hypertension Cohort). Also recruiting healthy control participants aged 7-18 years with normal blood pressure from local primary care practices (Control Cohort). Collecting blood and urine to analyze Ang-(1-7), ACE2, Ang II, ACE, uric acid, and klotho and measuring pediatric-specific outcomes (blood pressure (casual and ambulatory monitoring), indices of heart structure and function on echocardiogram (left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, left ventricular hypertrophy, etc.), kidney function (creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria, proteinuria, urine sodium/potassium), autonomic function (heart rate variability, blood pressure variability, baroreflex sensitivity), and vascular function (arterial stiffness, augmentation index)) at baseline and year 1 (Hypertension Cohort and Control Cohort) and year 2 (Hypertension Cohort). The objectives are to investigate if Ang-(1-7), ACE2, Ang II, and ACE identify phenotypic and treatment response variability and to causally infer if Ang-(1-7), ACE2, Ang II, ACE, uric acid, and klotho contribute to target organ injury, with these Specific Aims:\n\nAim 1:\n\n(1) Determine if plasma Ang-(1-7) or urine Ang-(1-7)/creatinine differ between the Hypertension vs. Control Cohorts and (2) assess if plasma Ang-(1-7) or urine Ang-(1-7)/creatinine mediate the effect of lisinopril-induced blood pressure reduction on the outcomes (change in heart function and structure, autonomic function, vascular function, and kidney function).\n\nHypothesis 1a: Baseline Ang-(1-7) is lower in the Hypertension vs. Control Cohort.\n\nHypothesis 1b: Increased Ang-(1-7) levels over time mediate the effect of lisinopril-induced decreased blood pressure on improved outcomes over 2 years in the Hypertension Cohort.\n\nAim 2:\n\n(1) Evaluate if plasma Ang-(1-7) or urine Ang-(1-7)/creatinine predict treatment response in participants in the Hypertension Cohort (change in casual blood pressure, ambulatory blood pressure, heart function/structure, autonomic function, vascular function, and kidney function); (2) compare to plasma renin activity and aldosterone; and (3) employ sensitivity analyses to quantify the impact of unmeasured confounding.\n\nHypothesis 2: Lower baseline Ang-(1-7) predicts greater outcome improvements in the Hypertension Cohort with lower unmeasured confounding and with greater predictive ability compared to plasma renin activity and aldosterone.\n\nAim 3:\n\nDetermine if plasma Ang-(1-7) or urine Ang-(1-7)/creatinine mediate the effects of uric acid and klotho on the outcomes in participants in the Hypertension Cohort. (1) Apply causal mediation to estimate if plasma Ang-(1-7) mediates the effects of uric acid on the outcomes (change in casual blood pressure, ambulatory blood pressure, heart function/structure, autonomic function, and vascular function). (2) Apply causal mediation to estimate if urine Ang-(1-7)/creatinine mediates the effects of klotho on the outcomes (change in casual blood pressure, ambulatory blood pressure, and kidney function).\n\nHypothesis 3a: Lower plasma Ang-(1-7) mediates the effect of high uric acid on the outcomes in the Hypertension Cohort.\n\nHypothesis 3b: Lower urine Ang-(1-7)/creatinine mediates the effect of low klotho on the outcomes in the Hypertension Cohort.\n\nAnticipated results have great potential to impact patient care by establishing Ang-(1-7), ACE2, Ang II, and ACE as biomarkers of treatment response, by establishing how Ang-(1-7) and other components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system change in response to an ACE inhibitor, by indicating which patients would benefit most from ACE inhibitors, by identifying novel etiologies of hypertension centered on alterations to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, uric acid, and klotho, and by leading to novel treatments. Indeed, these have been questions of great interest during the COVID-19 pandemic, as ACE2 is the binding site for Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2. Ultimately, the results from this study will improve patient outcomes by promoting cardiovascular health and preventing cardiovascular disease across the lifecourse."

        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Urodynamic studies routinely involve instillation of iohexol (OmnipaqueTM), a low osmolality contrast agent, into the bladder followed by fluoroscopic imaging to assess for reflux or variant anatomy of the genitourinary system. Recently, sulfur hexafluoride lipid-type A microspheres (LumasonTM), an ultrasound contrast agent, has been approved in the United States for intravesicular administration in the pediatric population. Contrast enhanced voiding urosonography (CEvUS) is being increasingly utilized in the place of voiding cystourethrograms, with the major advantages being decreased (zero) radiation for the patient, as well as decreased cost. Given the similarity in procedure between urodynamic studies (UDS) and voiding cystourethrograms, we hypothesize that a urodynamic study may be performed with contrast enhanced ultrasound instead of fluoroscopy. We plan to continue enrollment from our feasibility study and perform an efficacy study by recruiting a group of 105 patients under the age of 18, who are willing to undergo their normally schedule UDS using CEvUS to image the study in place of fluoroscopy. The UDS typically consists of two cycles of bladder filling and voiding; we intend replace the use of fluoroscopy and iohexel with ultrasound and sulfur hexafluoride lipid-type A microspheres. This will decrease the time commitment and eliminate radiation exposure for the patient. Data to be analyzed will include images from the study and patient/caregiver preference. Results from the ceVUS images will be compared to images obtained during previous tests imaged with fluoroscopy from the same patients currently enrolled in this study. Bladder shape and morphology, bladder neck configuration and performance, structure of the urethra, presence and degree of vesicoureteral reflux, and active voiding images will all be compared to fluoroscopy images from previous studies. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that ceVUS is effective as an imaging technique for urodynamic studies, with an ultimate goal of using ceVUS instead of fluoroscopy in all urodynamic and voiding studies in order to decrease pediatric radiation exposure. The hypothesis is that ceVUS will be as effective for imaging urodynamics studies as fluoroscopy."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Tonsillectomy is the second most common pediatric surgical procedure, with more than 280,000 performed in children under the age of 15 in the United States in 2010. The most common indications for tonsillectomy in children include recurrent infections and obstructive sleep apnea. While tonsillectomy in the pediatric population is generally safe and well-tolerated, post-operative complications are not uncommon, with post-operative pain, respiratory compromise, and post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage being chief among them.\n\nPost-operative pain has been described as the main morbidity associated with tonsillectomy and is often ineffectively controlled. Pain beyond the initial 24-hour post-operative period has been noted to be worse with the use of electrocautery when compared to cold-knife dissection and snare tonsillectomy, perhaps attributable to the high levels of heat (400 °C to 600 °C) applied directly to the tonsillar area. Yet electrocautery remains one of the most frequently utilized tools due to its hemostatic effects through vessel coagulation at the time of dissection. Still, a recent large meta-analysis reported the rates of primary post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage (bleeding within the first 24 hours) at 2.4% and secondary post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage (beyond 24 hours) at 2.6%, suggesting that bleeding after tonsillectomy remains a relatively common occurrence. The search for a methodology that improves post-operative pain without increasing the risk of post-operative hemorrhage remains an active area of research.\n\nCoblation, which creates an ionized plasma layer by passing a bipolar radio-frequency current through a medium of saline, offers another approach. The saline irrigation results in much less heat when compared to monopolar cautery, measuring approximately 40°C to 70°C. Coblation can be used in both subcapsular and intracapsular fashion. Subcapsular tonsillectomy with coblation has demonstrated a minimal decrease in pain, and may result in slightly higher rates of post-operative hemorrhage.\n\nIt has been pointed out that bipolar cautery could result in lower thermal injury and reduced blood loss, however tonsillectomy using traditional bipolar forceps leads to longer operative times. One group found that the use of BiClamp, a bipolar vascular sealing device originally designed for thyroidectomy, provided decreased operative times and less intraoperative bleeding compared to electrocautery. They noted, however, instances of posterior pillar perforation, which they attributed to curvature of the device that was designed for thyroid surgery, making dissection of the superior pole more difficult. Medtronic has now developed a similar device designed for use in tonsillectomy with a curved jaw meant to follow the contour of the tonsillar bed. In its marketing material for the recently developed BiZact , Medtronic describes a bipolar device that continuously measures the impedance of clamped tissue, adjusting energy levels in real-time and automatically stopping energy delivery when a seal is established. Their literature suggests the device permanently seals vessels up to 3mm with less thermal damage, resulting in less intraoperative blood loss, more efficient procedures, and possibly less pain.\n\nIn a pilot study of 186 patients, intraoperative blood loss was shown to be <1ml of blood loss in 71 cases (38.2%) and between 1 and 10ml of blood loss in 81 cases (43.5%). Post-operative hemorrhage rate of 4.3% is similar to rates described by other studies. BiZact tonsillectomy allows for a shortened operative time with a median time of 5.1 minutes. Other studies have shown other techniques to have a time duration of 21.6 minutes (electrocautery), 20.20 minutes (coblator), and 16.14 minutes (microdebrider).\n\nIn off label use of the device at our institution, data from surgeons using the device showed that surgeons perceived a relative improvement in following compared to standard tonsillectomy:\n\nLess perceived thermal heat transfer to surrounding soft tissues\nLeft perceived blood loss\nSuperior ease of obtaining timely hemostasis\nFaster operative time"

          "Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) commonly experience variances in tactile behaviors, such as hypersensitivity to light touch stimuli, altered texture discrimination and hyporesponsivity to pain. The degree of this somatosensory impairment correlates with increased anxiety behaviors as well as impairments in social behavior among ASD patients.\n\nThere remains an unmet need for suppressing the tactile hypersensitivity, which may improve anxiety and other core symptoms of ASD; however, methodologies for measuring tactile sensitivity vary widely across clinical and basic research fields. There is an urgent need for direct and objective sensory reactivity metrics in clinical studies to assess deficits in specific patient populations and for designing effective therapeutic strategies. As compared with traditional behavioral methods, the investigators propose to test novel, objective and quantitative metrics of somatosensory sensitivity in individuals with ASD.\n\nIn addition, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides a method of measuring cortical reactivity offering the advantage of providing behaviorally independent results that are largely unaffected by attention or cognitive ability. Therefore, a TMS-based physiologic biomarker may be applicable to all individuals across the autism spectrum. A form of TMS known as paired associative stimulation (PAS) can be used to study the suggested impairment in integration of sensory input into cortical function that underlies tactile hypersensitivity in ASD. Thus, the investigators aim to investigate somatosensory sensitivity and sensorimotor integration utilizing novel, objective behavioral assays and TMS.\n\nParticipation in the study will consist of up to seven visits: one screening visit, two sensory testing visits, and two - four TMS sessions. The screening visit is expected to last between 2-3 hours, during which participants will first provide informed consent. Participants will then receive a thorough medical examination by a neurologist, and a neuropsychological evaluation (including IQ measures and ASD specific evaluations). If eligible to continue, participants will then come back for two sensory visits and two - four TMS visits that are spaced a minimum of 1 week apart."

        "BriefSummary": [
          "Approximately 1.9 million youth sustain a concussion each year, and up to 30% experience persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS) such as headache, dizziness, and difficulty focusing that continue for weeks or months. PPCS results in greater utilization of sub-specialty care and can impact immediate and long-term social development, cognitive function and academic success. Previous recommendations for treating PPCS have focused on cognitive and physical rest, but more recently guidelines have shifted based on new research suggesting the benefit of rehabilitative exercise for PPCS. The rationale behind using exercise to treat youth with concussion is that gradually increasing physical activity facilitates return to full function. Rehabilitative exercise has since become one of the most common approaches to treating youth with PPCS, but access is challenging since most programs require weekly centralized visits with a concussion specialist. To bridge this gap, the investigators developed a telehealth-delivered approach to treat PPCS, utilizing physical activity trackers (Fitbits) and weekly video conferences with trained research staff. They then conducted a series of pilot studies with this approach, finding excellent feasibility, acceptability, and evidence for more rapid declines in concussive symptoms compared to controls. The investigators also found preliminary evidence that mechanisms behind this intervention may stem from both physiologic processes due to increased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and psychologic processes such as reducing fear- avoidance of concussive symptoms. They now propose a fully-powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) to asses the efficacy of the \"Mobile Subthreshold Exercise Program\" (M-STEP) for treating youth with PPCS."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "The investigators will recruit n=200 youth 11-18 years old with PPCS. Youth will be randomized to 6 weeks of either usual care plus M-STEP (intervention) or usual care plus stretching (control). Youth in M-STEP will be coached through gradual increases in intensity and duration of rehabilitative exercise via weekly video conferencing (Zoom) and will use Fitbits to guide their progress. Youth in the stretching group will act as attention controls. All youth will complete research-grade measures at multiple time points. Youth will be followed for a total of 6 months. Data will be analyzed using mixed effects models to examine differences between experimental groups in the primary outcome, trajectory of concussive symptoms, and the secondary outcome, changes over time in health-related quality of life, on an intention-to-treat basis. Potential mediators of the treatment effect will also be examined, including fear-avoidance of concussive symptoms and MVPA, and explore the impact of factors such as patient sex and parental protective behaviors.\n\nThe investigators thus assert the following hypotheses:\n\nHypothesis 1: M-STEP youth will have more rapid declines in HBI and improvement in PedsQL compared to control youth\n\nHypothesis 2: M-STEP youth will have greater increases in MVPA over time than control youth, and these increases will predict more rapid improvement in HBI and PedsQL.\n\nHypothesis 3: M-STEP youth will have steeper declines in fear-avoidance compared to control youth, and these declines will predict more rapid improvement in HBI and PedsQL.\n\nIMPACT: The proposed study will definitively answer the question of whether a mobile sub-threshold exercise program (M-STEP) improves outcomes for youth with PPCS. It will also provide essential information about both the long-term impact of this intervention and potential mediators as well as biopsychosocial factors that influence treatment response. The study design uses a rigorous protocolized smartphone administered mHealth intervention that will be readily reproducible and generalizable to the majority of youth with PPCS. If successful, this will be one of the few evidenced-based interventions available to treat youth with PPCS."

          "The study will use primary dysmenorrhea (PD; menstrual pain without an identified organic cause) as a model to examine biomarkers associated with menstrual and non-menstrual bodily pain in adolescent girls, ages 14-18. Participants will undergo extensive phenotyping including pain inhibition testing and multimodal neuroimaging to obtain indices brain structure and function at baseline and 12 months later. Menstrual pain severity and non-menstrual bodily pain will be assessed monthly for 24 months. Aims of the study are: 1) to identify the central mechanisms of PD using measures of pain inhibition and brain structure and connectivity of sensorimotor, default, emotional arousal, and salience networks, 2) to determine deficits in pain inhibition and alterations in brain structure and network connectivity that predict the one-year developmental trajectories of menstrual pain and non-menstrual bodily pain, and 3) to identify the dynamic relationship between alterations in pain inhibition and brain structure and connectivity with symptom change in menstrual pain and non-menstrual bodily pain. We hypothesize that deficits in endogenous pain inhibition and alterations in brain structure, connectivity, and function of regional networks will be positively associated with menstrual pain severity ratings at baseline and predict the trajectory of menstrual and non-menstrual bodily pain over 2 years. The results are expected to identify specific mechanisms and characteristics that predict the transition from acute/cyclical pain to persistent or chronic pain, which will support the development of therapies to prevent the transition from recurrent to chronic pain in adulthood."

          "The Safety-Net project, is intended to disrupt disparities in mental health treatment access for children at-risk for childhood trauma (ACEs) and/or serious emotional disturbance (SED). \"Safety Net\" will use mobile clinical and family support teams to improve mental health outcomes. This clinical innovation, nested in an integrated system-of-care will be piloted for children, ages 3-18 yrs., with SED who receive primary care through Cambridge Health CHA. Massachusetts had the highest rate of child abuse and neglect in the US during 2016 (DHHS, 2017). Approximately, 25% of these children live below the federal poverty level (American Community Survey, 2011-2013). The \"gateway\" cities this study targets in Metro-Boston (Malden and Everett) have 2-3 times the rate of foreign-born residents (43% vs. 15%) compared to the rest of the MA, and twice the statewide rate of children whose parental language is not English (54% vs. 22.3%). Together, SED and ACEs put children at much higher risk for adverse health and mental health outcomes in childhood and beyond.\n\nCHA's Children's Health Initiative (CHI) leadership will combine evidence-based interventions from its earlier MHSPY program (family support, care management and shared goals) with new strategies, such as interdisciplinary child mental health evaluation teams, all within primary care. Clinical expertise will be combined with peer-to-peer parent/guardian support for trauma-informed care delivery to both parent and child. All aspects of the care continuum will be provided in a culturally and linguistically competent manner, with child and family-driven care planning. Overall, the program will be sited in two cities, supported by a larger, specialized system of care involving state and local child serving agencies, schools and community-resources. The study team anticipates serving 248 children and families in total, at approximately 70 children per year. Program goals include: 1) Promote earlier recognition of child mental health needs; 2) Family-driven assessment approach to offset disparities in treatment engagement and outcomes; 3) Facilitate state, local and care planning team coordination and collaboration using SOC principles. Objectives: 1) Assess presence of SED (Serious Emotional Disturbance) via Standardized measures of Clinical Functioning (CGAS and CAFAS) 2) Screen for adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) by use of modified ACE-Q tool, 3) Increase access to child mental health evaluation and treatment using Pre-post measures of patterns of service use for study participants and Assessment of patterns of care for propensity-score weighted comparison group, 4) Improve family care experience, as measured by Baseline and follow-up Family Professional Partnership Scale assessments, 5) Improve clinical functioning, as measured by Baseline and follow-up CGAS and CAFAS assessments. Safety-Net's goals align with CHA's goals within its Accountable Care Organization contract with MassHealth, thus offering a chance to measure and evaluate outcomes for a customized system-of-care for some of the state's most"

This will be done by performing a fibroscan during each visit and comparing patient ALT and fecal microbiome at various intervals.\n\nThe primary endpoint is to assess the effect of probiotic treatment in liver steatosis and fibrosis by assessing with fibroscan using CAP score and TE staging. The higher the CAP score (S1, S2, S3) so worse the steatosis. TE staging (F0-F4), higher the staging indicates worsening of fibrosis.\n\nSecondary endpoints include:\n\nThe rate of decline of ALT over 3 month time interval and through whole study starting at initial diagnosis.\nThe rate of decrease in hepatic steatosis and BMI\n\nThis study will target pediatric patients with NAFLD. Participants will be new and previously diagnosed NAFLD patients between the ages of 5 years and 18 years.\n\nThis is single center study. Investigators will enroll patients from The Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Liver Disease and Nutrition.\n\nParticipants will be blindly randomized into one of two groups: probiotic or placebo.\n\nInvestigators expect the study to run for 1 year from 09/15/2020 to 09/14/2021. Investigators will enroll patients over a 6 month period. After randomization into two separate groups (probiotic vs placebo), Investigators plan to collect data for the subsequent 6 months following enrollment."

Our specific aims are: Primary: (1) Determine effectiveness of a pre-operative mHealth psychosocial intervention to improve acute pain outcomes in adolescents undergoing major musculoskeletal surgery, (2) Determine effectiveness of a post-operative mHealth psychosocial intervention to improve chronic pain outcomes at 3 months in adolescents undergoing major musculoskeletal surgery, (3) Determine the combined effects of pre- and post-operative psychosocial intervention on chronic pain outcomes. Secondary: (1) Determine effectiveness of pre-operative psychosocial intervention to reduce opioid use during the 14 days following hospital discharge, (2) Determine effectiveness of psychosocial intervention to improve health-related quality of life following surgery."

          "Ammonia is a waste product of protein and amino acid catabolism and is also a potent neurotoxin. The onslaught of high blood ammonia levels on the brain can manifest as cytotoxic brain edema and vascular compromise leading to intellectual and developmental disabilities. In addition, clinical hyperammonemia recurs at varying intervals, which can increase the cumulative damage to the brain and the chance of irreversible coma and death during a hyperammonemia episode due to vascular compromise or brain herniation. The threshold of tolerance for elevated blood ammonia is very low and concentrations above 100 µM can cause brain dysfunction manifested as nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and abnormal behavior; higher concentrations can cause coma and even death. Failure to remove ammonia can be due to inherited defects of the urea cycle, some defects in amino acid catabolism, and degradation of fatty acids.\n\nAim 1 - To determine the chronology of biomarkers of brain injury - S100B, NSE, and UCHL1 - in response to a hyperammonemic (HA) brain insult in patients with an inherited hyperammonemic disorder. We hypothesized that elevations of S100B, NSE, and UCHL1 will parallel the rise in blood ammonia. These biomarkers will be measured concurrently to ammonia levels throughout hospitalizations for HA until normalization of patient's blood ammonia and mental status.\n\nAim 2 - To determine if S100B, NSE, and UCHL1 are altered in patients with two other inborn errors of metabolism in which the primary pathology is neurological injury, Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) and Glutaric Acidemia (GA1). We hypothesize that neuronal and astroglial injury in these disorders may also result in increased levels of S100B, NSE, and UCHL1.\n\nMetabolic patients will be enrolled either during a hospitalization or in outpatient clinic, but outpatient enrollment is preferred. Metabolic patients typically have multiple laboratory tests performed at their outpatient visits. We will obtain the discarded blood samples from such laboratory tests in order to measure S100B, NSE, and UCHL1 levels at baseline (normal blood ammonia), which will provide data on biomarker levels following recovery from a hyperammonemic episode.\n\nDuring hospitalization for metabolic decompensation or for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, sequential measurements of S100B, NSE and UCHL1 levels will be obtained from discarded blood samples. We will obtain S100B, NSE, and UCHL1 levels from collected discarded blood samples at all subjects' next outpatient visit following their hospitalization, to determine if levels return to baseline."

To accomplish this goal, the study will enroll 750 adolescents with mTBI. Saliva RNA levels and symptoms will be assessed at <48 hours, 7 days, and 30 days post-injury. Aim 1 will assess the ability of saliva RNA dynamics (Δ from <48 hours to day 7) to predict PPCS 30 days after mTBI (defined by persistence of ≥3 symptoms on day 30, compared with pre-injury state on the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory; PCSI). RNA accuracy will be compared to a validated clinical prediction tool (5p tool). Aim 2 will assess the ability of saliva RNA dynamics (Δ from <48 hours to day 30) to identify recovered participants on day 30. RNA accuracy will be compared to change in composite score on a standardized reaction time test (from <48hrs to day 30). Completion of these aims will yield an objective biologic test that can be used for prognosis at the time of mTBI, and to aid clinical decisions regarding return-to-learn or return-to-play."

          "In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in obesity and its complications in both children and adults. Earlier treatment substantially reduces the likelihood of developing complications later in life while concurrently improving quality of life and decreasing mortality. Therefore, it is essential to develop safe and effective therapeutic strategies for weight loss, particularly in adolescents. Oxytocin (OXT), a hypothalamic peptide hormone that regulates energy balance, is a novel neuroendocrine weight-loss therapeutic in adults with obesity because it simultaneously reduces energy intake and increases energy expenditure and is well-tolerated. Data are currently lacking regarding effects of OXT administration in adolescents with obesity.\n\nThe current study is a 12-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) of OXT vs. placebo in 12-18-year old adolescents with obesity. We hypothesize that OXT administration will decrease weight as a consequence of decreased caloric intake and increased energy expenditure, both partially mediated by reduced hypothalamic inflammation (such inflammation drives weight gain by increasing food intake and reducing energy expenditure). Further, OXT will improve metabolic risk markers, such as visceral and intrahepatic fat, systemic inflammation, and serum lipids."

With a better understanding of normal AMH levels in children, we may be able to better assess a girl's risk of not being able to have children if she is a cancer patient, and may be able to offer her and her family options to increase the chances of having her own children."

          "This project will systematically plan and evaluate the implementation of the Transdiagnostic Sleep and Circadian Intervention for youth (TranS-CY). As an early stage study, investigators will focus on recruitment strategies to reach the target population and collection of preliminary data on primary and secondary effects of the TranS-CY. Weekly remote (video web conferencing) parent training sessions will allow investigators to explore adoption through parent adherence and examine whether the essential elements of the TranS-CY intervention (e.g., motivational interviewing, goal setting, problem solving, sleep routine scheduling, monitoring) can be consistently taught by clinicians and implemented by parents into the home setting."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Pre-phase (2 weeks in duration):\n\nInitial Interview: Following informed consent and enrollment, participants will complete a 45-60 minute interview with research investigators using video web conferencing (e.g., Zoom). If the participant agrees, this interview will be recorded. During this interview, investigators will gather descriptive data to characterize the sample including information regarding: 1) the child (age, disease severity for DMD, weight/ height, race/ethnicity, location (rural/suburban/urban), grade in school, medication use); 2) the parent (race/ethnicity, marital status, work status, education level, income); 3) the child's sleep environment (technology/telephone access, darkness, temperature, bed/bedroom sharing); 4) the child's daily activities and routines (current wake-up time & routines; activities in the home; activities at school and after school); and 5) the child's nighttime routines (activities prior to bedtime; current bedtime routine; technology use prior to bedtime).\n\nActiGraph: Each parent-child dyad will be mailed a package containing the Actigraph GT9x with wristband, charging device, a manual of operating procedures (MOP) providing all technical and protocol instructions, and phone numbers for research team support. Throughout the 2-week pre-phase data collection period, parents will be required to log and push data from their child's Actigraph to a secure cloud service, CentrePoint, via Wi-Fi each day. This will be accomplished through an app and all data will be de-identified.\n\nIntervention Implementation Phase (10-week duration):\n\nTraining Modules: During the intervention phase, weekly video-conference meetings will be held where trained clinicians will guide parents through approximately 60-minute web-based modules using a video-conferencing platform (e.g., Zoom). These sessions will focus on education, dynamic parent training (child-related goal-setting and problem-solving), assessment of sleep health dimensions, and development of a weekly sleep and activity diary. Parents will be provided with a personalized TranS-CY Parent Workbook, which contains information regarding each of the 10 weekly modules. Each weekly session will be agenda driven with the option to revise the agenda based on family needs. Children/youth with DMD will be invited to attend the sessions and provide as much feedback as possible. Data will be collected on parent attendance to assess intervention adoption. Each week, clinicians will request feedback on the previous week's session and provide additional educational support for the previous content should it be required.\n\nIntervention Questionnaires: During the 10-week intervention phase, parents will be asked to complete knowledge checks every 2-3 weeks in order to confirm understanding of the module information (primary outcome). These questionnaires will either be asked verbally during the session or questions will be sent to the parent's email through Qualtrics, a HIPAA compliant survey software platform. Hard copies of the knowledge checks will be sent if the parent prefers.\n\nSleep and Activity Log: Throughout the intervention phase, parents will be asked to complete a daily sleep and activity log covering their child's day. This log will be sent to their emails using Qualtrics. Each log will take approximately 3-5 minutes to complete.\n\nPost-Intervention Phase (2 weeks):\n\nActiGraph: At the end of the 10-week intervention, each participant (parent-child dyad) will again be mailed an Actigraph GT9x, all accessories and protocols. Throughout the 2-week post-phase data collection period, parents will again use their personal smart-phone app to log and push data from the Actigraph to CentrePoint, via Wi-Fi each day. Data from the Actigraph GT9x will be provide the secondary outcome of percent sleep efficiency. Investigators will explore change in percent sleep efficiency at pre-post 10 week TranS-CY intervention."

The purpose of this study is to determine if a wearable central line securement device, can decrease the number of line breaks, line dislodgment and line infections as compared to traditional securement techniques. The hypothesis is that the use of this wearable central line securement device can reduce line breaks, line dislodgment and line infections as compared to the traditional adhesive dressing. A secondary outcome for evaluation will be quality of life. Children are naturally active, however their activity is restricted by the parents given the delicate nature of their line. This study looks to see if quality of life can be improved a more secure wearable attachment device, as compared to traditional securement techniques."

Theatre interventions are led by Asante theatre personnel and evaluated by the PI and occupational therapy graduate students. The theatre intervention being evaluated has been conducted for decades by an established theatre company with widespread community participation and anecdotal positive responses, but has not been scientifically evaluated to understand how it impacts wellbeing. This will be the first large-scale study of the mechanisms of change and of the impact of the theatre intervention in the community and will help to guide future therapeutic interventions using theatre with underserved populations.\n\nResearch questions include: Is Sankofa a feasible and acceptable intervention for the target population? Does participation in Sankofa result in improved scores on wellness outcome measures, including the National Youth Outcomes Initiative (NYOI) survey?\n\nThe study is funded by Asante Children's Theatre via the Central Indiana Community Foundation Women's Fund."

          "This project will take place over a 3 year period and will consist of 10 6-week theatre interventions (5 for girls 8-12 and 5 for girls 13-18). The first two (pilot) interventions (one for each age group) are scheduled to take place in Spring of 2020. From Fall 2020 through Spring 2022 we will implement one intervention per age group each fall and one per age group each spring.\n\nThe theatre intervention is an Asante Theatre production that involves reading a script, being assigned a role, rehearsing, participating in discussions about the script that will contribute to script development/editing to personalize it, and eventually performing the play in front of a community audience. The play is free and open to the public and at the end of the performance participants will participate in a 'talk back' during which audience members can ask questions about the process. The talk back is moderated by the PI, and participants are not required to respond to questions but can speak up if/when they feel comfortable doing so. Theatre interventions are led by Asante theatre personnel and evaluated by the PI and occupational therapy graduate students. Evaluations take place after the PI obtains parental/guardian informed consent, the week after the intervention, 6 weeks follow up, and 6 months follow up. Evaluation sessions are conducted individually with each girl who signs up to participate, using data collection tools described below and attached in the 'notes/attachment' section, and will take no longer than 60 minutes. Adult audience members at performances are also participants of this study if they consent by checking \"Yes\" or \"No\" on the Audience Survey and responding to questions. The audience survey is described briefly below and attached in the notes/attachments section.\n\nFor 4 weeks leading up to each intervention, we will recruit by posting flyers throughout the Boys & Girls Club of Indianapolis (BGCI) where the interventions are to take place (we will implement at 5 different clubs throughout the city). We will also circulate flyers through BGCI social media and listservs, and send flyers home to parents. Girls who want to participate can let BGCI staff members know and BGCI staff will provide that girl's parent/guardian with an informed consent document to review and sign with the PI's contact information on it in case the parent/guardian has questions. The PI will call parents to ensure understanding and answer questions. She will also review the document to obtain assent from girls who want to participate and have their parents' signed consent forms."

          "The overall objectives of this work is to establish feasibility of a robotic ankle assist device (RAAD) to improve mobility in free-living settings and to establish the RAAD as an effective tool to provide increased dose and precision of targeted ankle therapy. The first specific aim is to complete a personal-use feasibility analysis of ankle mobility assistance. It is hypothesized the children will be able to safely walk faster and travel farther in the community when using the RAAD device vs. without the device. The second specific aim is to gather feedback to design and prototype a minimum viable product for use in clinical and community settings. The third specific aim is to quantify the potential for the RAAD system to increase the effectiveness of clinical gait therapy. Individuals with CP will complete three training sessions: RAAD assistance, RAAD resistance and standard of care. Muscle activity and step activity will be measured during each session. It is hypothesized that the RAAD assistance and resistance therapy will improve ankle plantar-flexor muscle activity and treatment session quality compared to traditional physical therapist-guided gait training. The fourth specific aim is to assess the benefits of repeated gait training with RAAD assistance and resistance. Individuals with CP will participate in a 4-week assistance or resistance intervention and mobility outcomes will be quantified pre and post intervention. It is hypothesized that both assistance and resistance training will improve mobility outcomes."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Indirect calorimetry allows accurate measurement of energy expenditure in this population but current technology is cumbersome and time-consuming, and has many limitations that exclude a majority of criticaly ill children. A new device was recently developed to address some of the limitations of IC devices and is widely endorsed for IC measurements in critically ill adults. The Q-NRG+ IC device incorporates an easier gas calibration technique to facilitate faster start up, and a micro-mixing chamber (2ml) allows rapid achievement of steady state gas exchange measurement. The device may address some of the current barriers for the use of indirect calorimetry in critically ill children. A device with short calibration time and reliable measurements could enhance the ability of clinicians to deliver individualized energy prescriptions for patients.\n\nDescription of Study Treatments\n\nFollowing informed consent, the following steps will be followed for the study procedure:\n\nThe two testing indirect calorimetry devices will be tested in an alternating fashion for each enrolled patient, therefore it will be decided the V(max) will be tested first in the first enrolled patient then the Q-NRG+ second. Each enrolled patient subsequently will alternate in which device is tested first.\nThe first device will be connected to the patient, after calibration, and data collection will begin for a maximum duration of 30 minutes.\nAt the end of the first testing period, the first device will be disconnected and the second device will be connected to the study patient.\nData collection for the second device will then begin for a maximum duration of 30 minutes.\nAt the end of the testing period, the data collected for the V(max) device will be discussed with the parents and the clinical team. Data collected from the Q-NRG+ will not be shared with the clinical team or family as this device is still being investigated in the pediatric population.\nThe study will then conclude.\n\nDefinitions of Outcomes/Endpoints The primary variables to be collected are steady state measurements of VO2 and VCO2 from both indirect calorimetry devices. Steady state will be defined as a period of greater than five minutes with coefficient of variation of the VO2 and VCO2 measurements of less than 10%. If steady state is not achieved, energy calculations will not be included in data analysis. Secondary variables to be collected include total time to obtain indirect calorimetry measurement, from arrival at the bedside to completion of the study. Steady state conditions will be defined using existing institutional practice.\n\nData Collection Methods and Assessments Descriptive characteristics will also be collected for each patient including age, weight, height, diagnosis, severity of illness, length of ICU stay, vital signs, and ventilator settings. We will also collect endotracheal tube size, presence of cuff, leak percentage. We will also collect information about medications, including inotropes and vasopressors, sedation medications (as well as SBS score) and nutrition parameters. Markers of inflammation, WBC and CRP will be collected from the patient chart.\n\nStatistical Analysis Descriptive statistics will be computed for measured REE, VO2 and VCO2 and Bland-Altman analysis will be utilized to quantify the mean bias and limits of agreement between devices. Acceptable limits of agreement between the devices will be +/- 20%. VO2, CO2 will be reported as means (SD). The time to steady state and total time of IC measurement will be compared using a T-test (if normally distributed) or Mann-Whitney U-test (if not normally distributed)."

        "BriefSummary": [
          "Childhood cancer treatments are increasingly effective, leading to dramatic improvements in survival rates. These treatments often have devastating effects on the overall health of pediatric cancer survivors (PCS) since they occur during a critical time of bone growth, including increased risks of poor bone health, fracture, and diabetes. In normal child development, physical activity habits influence bone density and structure, which affect bone strength in adulthood. Despite this well-understood principle of bone development, there are no exercise guidelines for improving bone health in PCS. The long-term goal of this research is to develop an effective exercise intervention to improve bone health after cancer therapy. As a first step, the investigators propose to test the hypothesis that the intensity and amount of ground impact of a child's daily physical activity will influence changes in bone density in PCS. The Specific Aims are to (1) examine the effect of physical activity on lumbar bone density of PCS and to (2) evaluate how physical activity influences bone density. In a prospective cohort study, the investigators will enroll 38 pediatric and adolescent survivors (ages 5-18) of acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma at any post-treatment time point. Aim 1: At two assessments, baseline and six months later, bone density and structure (by DXA scan, a type of x-ray that can measure bone density and the amount of muscle and fat in the body) and physical activity level (by accelerometry, a device like a fitness tracker) will be evaluated. Each child will be categorized as having low or high physical activity based on accelerometry measures averaged from baseline and six-month assessments. Bone changes (0-6 months) will be compared between low and high activity groups. Aim 2: Evaluate potential mechanisms by which physical activity mediates changes in bone, including the effects of lean mass (measured by DXA) and metabolic health (lipid panel, insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR, hemoglobin A1c), vitamin D). Long-term impact: This research will provide information as to the types of exercise that impact bone health in PCS. This study will help develop effective, evidence-based exercise therapies. These therapies may help prevent fractures and associated disability, leading to an improvement in the quality of life for survivors of pediatric cancer."

          "This project will examine habitual physical activity, bone health, and insulin resistance in pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoma cancer survivors at two time points: baseline and 6 months. At the two study timepoints, all study participants will be asked to wear an accelerometer, receive a DXA scan of the lumbar spine and hip, and have blood drawn for analysis. Study participants will be given a gift card stipend for each study visit attended. Study visits will coincide with regular office visits to Children's Hospital Oncology Clinic and the Children's Hospital Survivorship Clinics whenever possible. The potential mechanism by which physical activity mediates bone changes will be explored by concurrently measuring changes in lean/fat mass and metabolic status. This pilot study will provide data to inform the design of a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of a physical activity intervention on bone health in PCS."

        "BriefSummary": [
          "An external tunneled central venous access device (CVAD) is a small plastic tube that is tunneled under the skin into a major vein for long-term use (Figure 1). Patients who require a tunneled CVAD are some of the sickest patients we encounter and include oncology, hematology, and gastrointestinal (intestinal failure) patients. These patients are heavily reliant on their tunneled CVAD, which can be a lifeline for long-term administration of chemotherapeutics, IV medications, blood product transfusions, antibiotics, enteral nutrition, blood draws and fluids. Unfortunately, nearly 30% of pediatric external tunneled CVADs fail prior to the completion of treatment. External tunneled CVAD failures lead to unnecessary morbidity and mortality, interruption of medical therapy, and the added costs and risks associated with additional procedural complications. It is hypothesized that a newly designed securement method for external tunneled central venous access devices (CVAD) will reduce catheter-related complications and increase patient, parent and provider satisfaction, compared to the current standard of care, which is a clear transparent film dressing over the catheter exit site. A 20 patient, prospective clinical trial is proposed to address the following specific aims, which will determine if the securement device:\n\nIs rated by patients, parents and providers as easy to apply and comfortable for users\nReduces CVAD-related complications, such as delayed healing of the tract, catheter-related infections, and episodes of catheter dislodgement\nImproves the quality of life for patients and their parents\nIs preferred over the standard, clear transparent dressing alone\nRequires any design modifications to improve performance and/or comfort of the device"

Eligible patients will be identified by either mid-level providers, consulting services, or attending surgeons. Researchers will obtain consent from the patient or their parent/legal guardian. Caregivers will be educated on how to apply the securement device and will be given a number to call should they have any questions or concerns. Once the patient is enrolled and provided with the device, the investigators will perform follow up telephone interviews at one and three weeks to evaluate their experience and ensure they did not experience any adverse events.\n\nThe investigators will prospectively record the primary and secondary outcomes regarding use of the securement device, including: comfort, quality of materials, adhesive, ease of use, skin problems, infections, dislodgement episodes, catheter breakage, types and numbers of interactions with healthcare providers (phone calls, emergency department and clinic visits), perceived safety, and overall impressions."

The study aims to identify the effect of BFRT on quadriceps muscle strength and the patient's quality of life, and the overall tolerability of BFRT will be examined. Eight physical therapists at four sports medicine physical therapy (PT) sites will oversee all post-operative PT sessions.

        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Background:\n\nApproximately 100,000 anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions (ACLR) are performed yearly, and rates of these surgeries in patients younger than 15 years increased by 924% between 1990 and 2007.1 Persistent strength deficits in quadriceps musculature following ACLR are common, even several months after surgery and despite targeted physical therapy to address atrophy.2 Quadriceps atrophy and weakness are associated with worse patient-reported outcomes (PROs),3 as well as altered movement strategies and increased risk of reinjury.4,6 Approximately 20% of teenagers returning to sports will sustain a second ACL injury in the first two years following their ACLR.5 Regaining neuromuscular activation and strength of the quadriceps muscle safely and efficiently is vital to full recovery, and current post-operative physical therapy regimens have not sufficiently addressed this impairment.\n\nStrength training models recommend utilizing high resistance workloads to produce substantial strength gains,7 yet those recovering from orthopedic surgery are unable to tolerate heavy loads.8 Supplementing low-load resistance training with blood flow restriction (BFR-LLT) produces significant muscle hypertrophy and strength gains previously only thought to be achievable with high-load resistance training.9 BFR-LLT uses a tourniquet around the leg (see Appendix 4) to partially occlude venous return and decrease blood supply to the muscle being exercised. The generation of a low-oxygen environment and increases in plasma growth hormone levels has been shown to promote recruitment of motor units, improve neuromuscular activation, and result in muscular hypertrophy and growth.10-13 In adults and the elderly, improvements in quadriceps strength have been reported in up to 19%14 and increased quadriceps cross-sectional area in up to 6-7% compared to controls.15-16 To date there have only been four high-level studies investigating effects of BFR training in patients following ACLR17-20 and limited conclusions can be drawn from these studies due to lack of consistent methodology (variable cuff pressures and treatment frequency). More high-quality research is needed to determine treatment parameters that produce the most optimal results from this intervention in ACLR patients.\n\nAdditionally, there are no published randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of BFR training on exclusively adolescent patients. All high-quality BFR training research in patients following knee surgery have been conducted in late adolescent, young adult and adult populations.17-21 Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess the effect of BFR-LLT on quadriceps strength and outcomes in adolescents following ACLR.\n\nThis study's adolescent-specific focus provides a significant contribution to ACLR research, as younger patients demonstrate higher risk of reinjury.22-24 The results from this preliminary study will ultimately provide data to guide clinicians in optimizing quadriceps strength and utilizing BFR-LLT in younger post-operative ACLR patients.\n\nProtocol:\n\nThis randomized clinical trial is an interdisciplinary project between the CHOA Sports Medicine Physical Therapy department and Children's Physician Group (CPG) Orthopedics. As part of standard-of-care, all patients who plan to undergo ACLR by CPG Orthopedics surgeons are referred for at least one PT visit pre-surgery, at which time baseline strength measurements are obtained by the treating physical therapist. Pre-surgery collection of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is also standard of care for all patients undergoing ACLR.\n\nSkeletally mature male and female adolescents with closed growth plates documented by radiograph who undergo ACLR with quadriceps tendon autograft will be screened by a physical therapist (the PI or co-investigators) using medical notes.\n\nIf a patient meets criteria and consents, he/she will be enrolled into the study during the first routine-of-care post-surgery PT visit and randomized to undergo standard post-surgery rehabilitation (control group) or standard post-surgery rehabilitation with supplemental BFR-LLT (test group) as demonstrated in Figure 1 and Appendix 1. Participants will be randomized using a computer program that will generate random numbers to assign participants to the test group or the control group. Participants will be asked to complete four PROs throughout the study (Lysholm, Pedi-IKDC, ACL-RSI, and AMCaMP - see Appendix 5.1-5.4). All relevant demographic, physiological, and radiographic data will be collected at the time of enrollment via RedCap, through a secure link. Data will be stored in a password-protected file on a secure Children's server and only the PI, Co-investigators, and research coordinator will have access.\n\nEight physical therapists (all CITI-trained) at four sports medicine PT sites will oversee all post-surgery PT sessions. Participants in the control group will follow a standard post-surgery rehabilitation protocol starting 2-5 days post-surgery and attend two PT visits per week until 16 weeks post-surgery. The test group will follow an identical schedule of PT visits but will have two to three exercises in each session supplemented with BFR treatment using the Delfi Personalized Tourniquet System (PTS). Requirements of BFR treatment are described below. For both groups, each session will last approximately 60 minutes. Each of the exercises performed with BFR will last 5-18 minutes, with total time under occlusion not exceeding 30 minutes per visit.\n\nParticipants undergoing BFR treatment will wear limb protection sleeves designed to help protect the skin beneath the cuff while the cuff is pressurized. Skin integrity will be monitored pre- and post-treatment at each session. If a study participant reports intolerable pain levels during BFR, the physical therapist will fully deflate the cuff and BFR treatment will cease for that PT session. Any adverse events will be reported to the PI and Co-I's within 24 hours. All required medical assessments will be promptly performed.\n\nIf a participant is assigned to the test group, BFR intervention will end after 16 weeks post-surgery. Both the test group (BFR-LLT) and the control group will follow standard of care treatment after week 16 post-surgery, including the standard post-intervention functional testing at 24 weeks post-surgery.\n\nParticipants will be asked to complete PROs periodically throughout the study as listed below under data collection. All physical examination measures and testing listed are standard of care for ACLR rehabilitation patients. Details on the regimen followed by both cohorts during the full 6-month rehabilitation are outlined in Appendix 1.\n\nBFR-LLT Treatment Requirements:\n\nThe BFR-LLT intervention requires participants to follow the two requirements listed below, as the treatment parameter of 80% LOP has been widely recommended as the ideal amount of blood flow occlusion throughout the literature. Participants who do not meet these criteria will be excluded from the study but will continue to receive standard of care for post-surgery ACLR rehabilitation.\n\nTolerate a personalized pressure of 80% of the limb occlusion pressure (LOP) for 100% of all physical therapy visits in which BFR-LLT is utilized.\nTolerate BFR-LLT for a minimum of 20 visits over 16 weeks.\n\nData Collection:\n\nDemographic data (pre-surgery, which is standard of care) will include age, gender, race/ethnicity, height/weight, physeal status, and assessment of baseline activity level with the Tegner Activity Scale (see Appendix 6)\nPatient-reported outcomes (PROs) (see Appendix 5) will include the Pediatric Internal Knee Documentation Committee (Pedi-IKDC, Appendix 5.1), Lysholm Score (Appendix 5.2), ACL-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) confidence assessment (Appendix 5.3) and Adolescent Measure of Confidence and Musculoskeletal Performance (AMCaMP,Appendix 5.4). These PROs are collected pre-surgery as standard of care, but further collection and reassessment of PROs as described in Figure 2 will be unique to study participants. Surveys will be collected and recorded on iPads with direct entry into REDCap and in each participant's confidential EHR on the treatment note from the day the data was collected. All responses will be stored on a secure RedCap server through a secure link and data will be stored in a password-protected file on a secure Children's server. Only the PI and Co-I's will have access to the data."

        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "The current study involving human subjects consists of a Randomized Controlled Trial to test the feasibility, effectiveness, and implementation of the TASC intervention as compared to a treatment as usual group. A total of up to 70 adolescents with moderate or severe persistent asthma between the ages of 12-18 years will be randomized to TASC (n=35) or treatment as usual (n = 35). After adolescent participants have met inclusion criteria, completed baseline assessments, and have been enrolled in the feasibility RCT, they will be randomized to either TASC or Treatment As Usual (TAU). Outcomes measures (adherence and disease severity) will be assessed at baseline, monthly during active treatment, and at post-treatment, with the primary endpoint being post-treatment. Participants will be enrolled in the study for a duration of six months. The TASC intervention will be delivered using technology so that participants do not need any resources to travel to appointments. Step 1 (Information) will include electronic educational information related to asthma symptoms and triggers, attacks, self-monitoring, treatments, action plans, and automated text message medication reminders. Step 1 will be provided to all adolescents. Adherence will be electronically monitored, but feedback will not be provided. Step 2 (Motivation) will include electronic monitoring of adherence and personally tailored feedback via text messages. Adolescents will be given access to the adherence tracking smartphone app and graphs of their inhaler adherence. Adolescents will also receive brief, personalized text messages that provide supportive motivation and directive, tangible actions. Step 3 (Behavioral) will include problem-solving telehealth intervention with a trained clinician. Four telehealth sessions individually tailored to the unique needs and barriers of the adolescent will be provided. These will be based on a functional analysis via objective adherence data, graphical feedback, and discussion of adherence patterns allowing for a comprehensive understanding of specific behavioral factors interfering with adherence. Behavioral treatment plans will be modified based on a patient's progress in treatmentand ability to achieve short-term adherence goals. Patients will also be contacted via text messaging to assess success with specific adherence plans between sessions based on objective data. This telehealth intervention will be delivered to adolescents' cell phones via video conferencing software.\n\nAll participants will complete baseline questionnaires related to demographic, and clinical predictors of adherence and asthma. They will be randomized following completion of baseline measures. Inhaler adherence caps will also be provided to all participants and utilized for 2 months without feedback to obtain baseline adherence. In addition, all participants receive a mobile spirometer to track their lung function throughout the study. The spirometer connects to an app via Bluetooth. This app allows the participant to perform pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and view the results of these tests, such as their forced expiratory volume (FEV1) as well as other lung function parameters. All participants will be asked to use the spirometer at least once a month when completing study visits over the phone with a study team member. Following the baseline visit, an 8 week run-in phase will be completed to assess baseline adherence using electronic inhaler monitoring. After obtaining 4 weeks of adherence data, the coordinator will call the participants in TASC and TAU for their first monthly phone call. After an additional 4 weeks of adherence data, the coordinator will call the participants in the TASC and TAU for their second monthly phone call. The coordinator will calculate baseline adherence and obtain data for asthma severity and asthma control for TASC and TAU participants. For TASC participants only, the coordinator will introduce Step 1 of the intervention for all participants. Adherence checks will continue to occur every four weeks for the duration of the study for all participants and adherence <68% will prompt movement from one level of treatment to the next for TASC participants only. The study coordinator will calculate TASC participant's adherence percentage prior to the monthly telephone call. During the call, the coordinator will tell the participant if they will get moved up to the next step and explain what they will be doing during that step. TASC participants may remain at a treatment level for more than four weeks and may complete 1, 2, or 3 interventions steps during the 5 month study depending on the adolescent's adherence. Brief measures will be completed by all participants online via REDCap. Participant specific data such as asthma severity, lung function, and adherence will be collected through the mobile phone application and via telephone. Clinical chart reviews will be conducted by study staff to provide an accurate estimate of lung function and disease severity from the date of consent to the end of study date."

          "Cerebral palsy (CP) results from a perinatal brain injury and is one of the most prevalent and costly pediatric neurologic conditions in the United States that often results in mobility deficits. The investigator's extensive experimental work has been focused on developing a therapeutic gait training protocol that will improve the long-term mobility of adolescents and young adults with CP. Despite the major breakthroughs, it is apparent across the investigations that some patients have vast improvements in their mobility after treatment, while others are clearly non-responders. This response variability represents one of the major Gordian knots in the treatment outcomes seen in adolescents and young adults with CP. The investigator will address this knowledge gap with a multimodal approach that blends the investigator's expertise in MEG/EEG brain imaging, MRI spinal cord imaging, and assessments of the spinal cord interneuronal circuitry to probe the neurophysiological differences in participants that are classified as responders and non-responders after therapeutic gait training. The Specific Aims of this study will: (1) identify if responders and non-responders have differences in the strength of the sensorimotor cortical oscillations involved in the planning and execution of a leg motor action, (2) determine if responders and non-responders have differences in the neural synchrony within the somatosensory cortices, following stimulation of the foot mechanoreceptors, and (3) decipher if responders and non-responders have differences in the spinal cord microstructure and circuitry dynamics. (4) Secondary aim: assess cognitive related changes induced via physical therapy. Briefly, the study design consists of a cohort of adolescents and young adults with CP that will initially undergo MEG/EEG brain imaging, MRI spinal cord imaging, neurophysiological tests of the spinal cord interneuronal circuitry, cognitive testing, and clinical mobility assessments. After completing the baseline tests, the participants will undergo the therapeutic gait training protocol. Upon completion of the treatment program, the participants will repeat the same assessments that were completed at baseline. Separation of the participants into responders and non-responders to treatment will be based on the criteria for a clinically relevant change in the 10-meter walking speed test. The new data derived from this project will provide unparalleled insight on the potential neurophysiological origins of the diverse mobility outcomes seen in adolescents and young adults with CP after treatment. Finally, an additional cohort of neurotypical adolescents and young adults of similar age and sex will also complete the mobility, MEG/EEG, spinal cord imaging, and Hoffmann reflex protocols for comparative purposes."

The proposed research will be conducted in two phases. Phase I consists of: (a) the development of the prototype using input from 4 focus groups of 5 adolescents each (n = 20), aged 16-18 and the extant literature (Specific Aim #1). In Phase II will consisted of a pre-post pilot study with 20 teens ages 16-18 collecting assessment data at baseline and immediately following gameplay to assess 1) the intervention's acceptability and feasibility by collecting quantitative and qualitative data on teens' satisfaction and gameplay experience of the intervention, and 2) the preliminary impact of the intervention on knowledge, intentions, perceptions, attitudes, social norms, self-efficacy and behaviors related to alcohol use and harm reduction.\n\nConduct focus groups to gather data to develop the AR videogame prototype, \"No Time Wasted\": Four focus groups will be conducted (5 adolescents each) to collect feedback on the game content, narrative, characters, and gameplay mechanics. To facilitate the discussions, visual tools (e.g., storyboards, pictures) will be used. The focus groups will be conducted according to standard dual-facilitator procedures. The four focus groups will be adequate to achieve thematic saturation. The focus groups will be conducted such that ideas and themes from one discussion inform discussion topics and prompts used in the next focus group. Audio recordings of each session will be transcribed, reviewed, and discussed by the research team to refine the videogame intervention. As a part of the game development and with parental permission, selected students will be invited to the Yale recording studio on campus to provide voices for the videogame characters.\n\nConduct a pre-post pilot study: This study will enroll 20 adolescents ages 16-18 using a pre/post design to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the AR videogame prototype. Participants will accumulate between 1- 1.5 hours of game play over 2 sessions (approximately one week, meeting twice). This total duration and number of sessions is consistent with those found in effective alcohol harm reduction and prevention interventions, which range from 10 minutes to 4 hours, and with the amount of time adolescents play videogames. Participants will have a 15-10 min break in the middle of each session and will be instructed that they may take additional breaks as needed."

          "Successful models of injury prevention in occupational health settings focus largely on motor skill education for employees. Sports-related injury prevention programs lack this critical component. This research question is being asked to help inform the development of a comprehensive implementation strategy for a high school sports injury prevention program.\n\nThe Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) Sports Safety ACL Program is a unique, public health approach to ACL injury risk management. The program offers pioneering education to those directly responsible for the safety of young athletes. The program offers diverse educational opportunities and innovative risk management resources directly to coaches, parents, administrators, and young athletes. The program has already held over 200 live workshops, teaching coaches, parents and young athletes how to identify injury risk factors and how the relationship between movement quality and sports performance impacts injury rates. Though several research studies have been conducted with the HSS Sport Safety Program, this study is the first to evaluate the association between athlete motor learning and movement quality.\n\nCurrently anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury prevention programs focus on clinicians and coaches leading a series of neuromuscular training exercises repeatedly throughout a sports season to improve athlete strength, balance, flexibility, and agility. While this has shown been shown to be effective in controlled research settings, there have been many problems with implementation, including low compliance. Hartigan et al recently conducted a study showing that athletes had improved jumping and landing technique after viewing video feedback. This is evidence that movement education/feedback has the ability to affect motor skills. Demonstrating an association between motor skill education and improved movement quality would allow the responsibility of ACL injury prevention to be more readily shared by both sports medicine clinicians and athletes.\n\nThis evidence would provide support for the public health approach to ACL injury risk management on which the HSS Sport Safety Program was based. In addition, providing solid evidence of the program's success will make the program more marketable to schools, clubs, and other sports groups nationally and internationally."

          "Mitochondria are essential for a wide range of functions in almost every cell in our body. Best known for their role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, mitochondria are also closely involved in a wide variety of cell functions such as calcium buffering, redox regulation, apoptosis and inflammation, and regulate metabolism through several mechanisms, including epigenetic changes. ATP produced is essential for many cellular systems. Thus, abnormal mitochondrial function can adversely affect cellular systems by several mechanisms.\n\nGiven the important role of the mitochondria in cellular function, individuals with classic mitochondrial disease demonstrate devastating symptoms, particularly in tissues that have high-energy demands such as the brain, muscles, gastrointestinal (GI) tract and immune system. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of more common diseases, including psychiatric diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, neurological disorders including migraine and seizures, persistent systemic inflammation, cardiac disease, cancer and diabetes. Mitochondrial dysfunction also effects a significant portion of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as well as genetic syndromes associated with ASD.\n\nOne of our goals is to develop a method using the Seahorse Analyzer to measure individual variations in mitochondrial function which can identify children with medical disorders and mitochondrial dysfunction without an invasive muscle biopsy. In order to establish comprehensive profiles of mitochondrial function for individuals with known neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders, we will compare blood, urine, and stool from these individuals to those of healthy, typically developing (TD) children. The relationship between mitochondrial function, development, and behavior will be assessed by performing standard developmental testing. In addition, in patients who have a procedure that produces leftover tissue, we will examine the mitochondrial function in that tissue and correlate it with findings from blood."

          "The current study explores the development and use of a family engagement intervention for psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents with emerging psychosis symptoms. The program is designed to increase understanding of mental health symptoms and promote motivation for engagement in outpatient services. Findings from this study may inform ways to effectively educate and engage youth at clinical high risk for psychosis, and their families, in treatment that may be critical for improving future functioning and outcomes."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Many individuals who develop psychotic disorders report having experienced subthreshold psychosis (i.e., clinical high risk-CHR- symptoms) in adolescence, prior to full-threshold symptoms. The emergence of symptoms during this critical stage of maturation can cause a great deal of distress and disruption, oftentimes leading to long-term illness and functional impairment. Evidence supporting the benefits of psychosocial treatment, particularly family-oriented team-based approaches, for young people in the early stages of psychosis has inspired ongoing efforts to identify symptoms as early as possible. Identification and service engagement can facilitate risk monitoring, and early treatment (for psychosis and/or co-occurring concerns) maximizes recovery and minimizes the negative sequelae of illness. Given that many CHR youth seek help for a variety of mental health concerns prior to the emergence of full psychosis, often through emergency services, and many do not disclose psychosis-spectrum symptoms spontaneously, targeted CHR assessment and intervention within a general psychiatric population is important.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to identify psychiatrically hospitalized teens who present with new onset CHR symptoms and pilot, via a randomized trial, a brief intervention to enhance outpatient treatment engagement post-hospitalization. The intervention will directly target three mechanisms linked to service use: mental health literacy, attitudes toward treatment, and family partnership (i.e. family involvement and co-engagement in treatment). In the experimental group, teens and caregivers will participate in a brief intervention informed by existing evidence-based treatment protocols. The proposed intervention will include three modules: 1) assessment of psychosis-risk symptoms and treatment attitudes and barriers, 2) an evidence-based psychoeducation module designed for young people with psychosis-risk syndromes and their families, and 3) an empirically-supported motivational enhancement protocol developed for teens and parents to increase outpatient service use after hospital discharge.\n\nThe investigators will first pilot the intervention with parent-teen dyads (n = 20-30) using an iterative approach to refine the content and delivery. To inform intervention development, post-intervention session evaluations and qualitative exit interviews will be used to explore attitudes and opinions regarding intervention content and delivery. After this development phase, the investigators will conduct a randomized open trial comparing treatment-as-usual (TAU) to TAU + the experimental intervention (n = 80 dyads). TAU includes standard care modules (psychoeducation, coping, safety planning, problem solving, healthy lifestyle) administered to the teen. All teens, as part of TAU, also receive skills groups, individual treatment, and family planning meetings. Additionally, all enrolled families (experimental and TAU) will receive a referral to an outpatient provider for psychosocial treatment (standard care procedure) plus referral to specialized CHR case management services. Case management, if elected, will be provided through the local coordinated specialty care (CSC) psychosis-risk clinic, which offers empirically-supported team-based services including case monitoring, consultation to outside providers, and group and family treatment. Primary outcomes, measured at 1- and 3-month follow-ups, include the engagement of the purported therapeutic mechanisms (i.e. mental health literacy, attitudes toward treatment, family partnership). Secondary outcomes include outpatient service use and rates of enrollment in CSC case management services across groups."

          "Institutional review board approval was obtained. Children ages 5-18 years old referred to the pediatric urology clinic for primary nocturnal enuresis will be screened for enrollment. Behavioral modification (limiting evening drinking, double voiding prior to bedtime, bowel habits, social anxiety factors) will be utilized first. Patients who fail will next be offered therapy with a bedwetting alarm device or a TENS unit as an alternative, and those who chose TENS therapy will be included in the study. Patients who have previously tried pharmacologic treatment for nocturnal enuresis or alternative therapy for urologic disorders within the past 30 days, daytime incontinence symptoms, known \"high volume\" voiders (determined from history), bedwetting episodes on the average of less than one time per week, medications predisposing to incontinence (eg, Lithium for bipolar disorder), other known voiding or neurologic disorders (eg, overactive bladder, myelomeningocele), secondary etiologies for nocturnal enuresis (eg, cystitis, obstructive sleep apnea, urinary fistulae), prior use of a TENS unit or other neuromodulation for bedwetting, and any contraindications to usage of a TENS unit such as having a pacemaker will be excluded. Patients who have previously tried the bedwetting alarm will not be excluded from the study.\n\nThe patients will be randomized into three groups of 20 patients each. Group 1 will be the long frequency set at 2 Hz. Group 2 will be the moderate frequency set at 10 Hz. Group 3 will be the short frequency set 150 Hz. There is no sham group in this study as the investigator has previously found posterior tibial TENS to be effective and lasting, and as such all patients will be treated. The investigator will aim to recruit 20 patients per group for a total of 60 patients. Detailed explanation of the purpose if the study, along with the risks and benefits of TENS will be given to the patient and caretakers by a provider prior to obtaining informed consent for enrollment into the study. The patients will be provided with a TENS unit and electrode pads and caretakers instructed on how to use the apparatus.\n\nParents/patients of enrolled patients will fill out nightly voiding diaries, recording nighttime incontinence episodes and subjective \"wet sheets\" scale per night (dry, damp, wet, soaked) for 30 days prior to randomization into the treatment arms. The TENS sessions will be performed nightly at bedtime for 15 minutes for 30 days. TENS units will be set at a frequency of 10Hz, and intensity determined in the office by the sensitivity threshold of the patient. Voiding diaries will be kept each night while on TENS therapy. A voiding diary will also be completed 30 days before TENS treatment, patients and families will fill out the Pediatric Urinary Incontinence Questionnaire (PIN-Q), a validated tool for measuring quality of life in children with bladder dysfunction. Patients will follow up at day 30 and as needed (worsening symptoms, adverse reactions, concerns, and questions regarding usage of TENS). Patients who record 2 wet nights per week (a total of 8/30=27% wet nights) will be eligible for the TENS study. Those who record less than 2 wet nights per week will be ineligible for the TENS study but will be offered therapy using a bedwetting alarm device or other treatment."

In the event of significant gastrointestinal toxicity, the treatment schedule may be modified from continuous dosing to an intermittent regime (e.g. 1 week of dosing followed by 1 week not dosing), except during Cycle 1 of the dose escalation phase.\n\nIn the case of toxicity, the dose of 2-OHOA may be reduced or delayed by no more than 14 days at the discretion of the Investigator.

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "This pilot study will enroll patients at Texas Children's Hospital, aged 6 months to <18 years scheduled to undergo a clinically indicated thoracic surgery with the adjunct of an erector spinae plane block for perioperative pain. A single shot erector spinae plane block is commonly offered for unilateral video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and unilateral chest tube insertions. Following parental consent and child assent to the block, participants will be assigned sequentially to either ropivacaine 0.2% at 0.3ml/kg or ropivacaine 0.5% at 0.3ml/kg. This pilot study poses no additional risk to the patient and the thoracic surgical procedures outlined are those for which an erector spinae plane block would be offered. Furthermore, the block dosing of 0.3ml/kg volumes with ropivacaine 0.2% or 0.5% are not outside of the standard of care or accepted dosages for peripheral nerve blocks.\n\nVenous sample serum ropivacaine levels will be collected prior to ESP block and at 30, 60, 90-minutes and 2, 4, 6 -hours from intravenous access in situ. A baseline alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) test will be collected and processed by TCH Pathology. Amide local anesthetics are predominantly protein bound to AGP. It is the unbound form that is active. While this study seeks to understand the pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine following a single shot erector spinae plane block, correlate of the AGP will simultaneously ascertain the free vs bound portion.\n\nSamples will be analyzed for the total and free serum ropivacaine concentrations. Pain scores will be collected from nursing records starting from arrival in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit every 4 hours (up to 12 hours after arrival in PACU). Pain will be measured using The Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scale (FLACC), the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale (FACES), and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)."

Using cluster randomization, 564 participants eligible for the study will be offered one of two different depression prevention programs in multiple sites in Chicagoland, Rockford, Illinois; Dixon, Illinois; and Louisville, Kentucky. In response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we will employ a public health media campaign to recruit a second cohort of 100 adolescents state-wide in Illinois, Kentucky, and Massachusetts individually randomized to either intervention. The study will also assess teens', parents' and providers' experiences with each intervention approach. Finally, we will examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents at-risk for depression who are enrolled in our study."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "The majority of mental, emotional and behavioral (MEB) disorders have an initial onset before age 24, with 20% annual incidence, with major depressive disorder (MDD) being the most common MEB. Health systems, eager to reduce costs, want to transition from the current \"wait until sick enough for treatment\" model for MDD to a preventive model. However, evidence is needed for (1) the comparative effectiveness of a \"scalable intervention\" and (2) an implementation model for such a scalable intervention in the primary care setting. This study is a comparative effectiveness trial evaluating the efficacy of two evidence-based cognitive-behavioral prevention (CBP) programs: Teens Achieving Mastery over Stress (TEAMS), the \"gold standard,\" group therapy model, and Competent Adulthood Transition with Cognitive Behavioral, Humanistic and Interpersonal Training (CATCH-IT), a scalable, self-directed, technology-based model. For implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic, TEAMS has successfully been adapted to an online format and administered online through HIPAA-compliant video conferencing software. For the first cohort, 564 eligible adolescents age 13-18 will be offered one of two different depression prevention programs using cluster randomization in multiple sites in urban and suburban Chicago, Illinois; rural Western Illinois, including Dixon and surrounding towns; and Louisville, Kentucky. Randomization will be blocked into matched pairs of primary health care clinics and school sites and stratified by race, ethnicity, rural-urban commuting area codes, and socio-economic disadvantage using the Distressed Communities Index (DCI) from census-tracked data of each site zip code. A second cohort of 100 eligible adolescents will be recruited through public health media campaigns in Illinois, Kentucky, and Massachusetts utilizing the same eligibility criteria as Cohort One. These participants will connect with the research team by phone, email, web survey, or social media and will be randomized at the individual-level with equal allocation into treatment conditions (CATCH-IT or TEAMS). The investigators will comprehensively evaluate patient-centered outcomes and stakeholder-valued moderators of effect at 2, 6, 12, and 18 month assessment points. Using a hybrid clinical trial design that simultaneously examines implementation process, the study will also assess adolescents', parents' and providers' experiences (i.e. efficacy, time commitment, cultural acceptability, and implementation cost) with each intervention approach. A sub-sample of Cohort Two (n=50, 25 from each intervention arm) will be recruited to participate in open-ended interviews for adolescents to share their experiences of living with subsyndromal depression, coping during the COVID-19 pandemic, their perceived impact of CATCH-IT or TEAMS on their mood and behavior, and the cultural contexts in which these experiences occurred."

          "The goal of the SPAS trial will be to determine the role of prophylactic antibiotics in closed reduction and percutaneous fixation of pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures. The study will be designed as a prospective, double-blinded, two-arm, non-inferiority trial. The control arm will receive standard of care preoperative prophylactic antibiotics. The intervention group will receive a preoperative saline placebo. The primary outcome of the study will be the development of a surgical site infection, including all infections both superficial and deep. Secondary outcomes will include rate and type of post-operative complications in either group, to account for any drug-related adverse outcomes. The hypothesis is that this surgery is safe to perform without prophylactic antibiotics, and the investigators anticipate finding no difference in infection rates between the two groups. Inclusion criteria will consist of an isolated, closed, displaced supracondylar humerus fracture treated with closed reduction and temporary percutaneous pinning. Immunocompromised patients, pathological fractures, open fractures, polytrauma, skeletally mature patients, and those treated primarily with open reduction or those converted to open reduction will be excluded. Because of the low infection rate observed in this type of surgery, the sample size for the study is estimated at 600 patients per arm for adequate power. With a multicenter design, the expectation will be enrollment over the course of 1-2 years with a follow up of approximately 3 months post-surgical intervention per participant."

Does the use of BFR-based exercise improve strength, hypertrophy, functional and patient reported outcomes after ACL Reconstruction in the adolescent population?"

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "The planned pilot study is a prospective case control study utilizing retrospective controls. The investigators will compare the use of exercises augmented with BFR with quantitative measurements of strength and patient reported outcomes. A total of 20 youth and adolescent patients undergoing a surgical procedure for ACL reconstruction at Connecticut Children's Elite Sports Medicine and completing physical therapy at Connecticut Children's Sports Physical Therapy will be recruited for this study. A review of data from 20 previous patients, matched for age, sex, BMI and surgical procedure that completed physical therapy at Connecticut Children's Sports Physical Therapy will be used as a comparison.\n\nAs part of this pilot study, the investigators will additionally collect prospective controls. This population will be patients not participating in physical therapy at Connecticut Children's, but underwent ACL reconstruction by Elite Sports Medicine. The investigators are unsure of the ability for us to collect prospective controls in a timely manner, hence the investigators will use the above described retrospective cohort as controls if the prospective controls prove difficult to recruit.\n\nIdentification and Recruitment:\n\nAll potential patients undergoing ACL reconstruction at Elite Sports Medicine will be approached for participation for this study. Eligible patients will be identified at their initial pre-operative appointment with the Sports Medicine Physician, Athletic Trainer, and Sports Physical Therapy Physical Therapist. Subject selection will be completed by those patients meeting the above outlined inclusion and exclusion criteria. At this time, the study purpose and protocol will be explained and a brief summary of the study will be provided.\n\nConsent: Consent will take place at the pre-operative visit. The patient/parent will be given a detailed description of the purpose and methodology for this study. The participants will have the opportunity to read the consent forms and ask any questions they may have about the research. If the patients agree to participate, they will be asked to sign the consent form and a copy will be provided.\n\nRetention: Eligible patients will be required to be seen for a minimum of 90% of patient visits to be included in this study.\n\nIn addition to the standard ACL protocol, patients in this study will utilize the Owen Recovery Science exercise protocol for BFR [18]. The following guidelines will be followed concerning exercise progression, occlusion pressure and difficulties with volume achievement. To determine the appropriate resistance for each exercise, the patient's 1 repetition maximum (1RM) will be attained using a repetition test [19]. This test will use a previously validated algorithm to determine the 1RM based on the weight used to perform a 7-10 repetition test [20]. Patient will perform the exercise with a weight they can comfortably lift for several repetitions. Based on the weight or resistance used, and the patient's perceived exertion a 1RM will be estimated using the modified OMNI-RES (OMNI perceived exertion scale for resistance). The starting load for each exercise will be 20-30% of their 1RM , or bodyweight resistance will be used when loading is not feasible.\n\nProposed Protocol Phase 1- Weeks 1 to 2\n\nQuad Set: 10 second on, 10 second rest at 100% occlusion x10'\n\no progress to isometrics at the edge of the table 60 degrees as clinically appropriate\n\nSide Lying Hip Abduction, 30/15/15/15, at 80% occlusion\nHip Extension from prone 30/15/15/15, at 80% occlusion\nRe-check load at the start of each Phase, to determine 1 RM (7-10 RM (repetition maximum) test on leg press)\nTotal BFR time approximately 24 minutes per session, with 2 sessions per week\n\nPhase 2- Weeks 3 to 4\n\nReplace Quad Set with Long Arc Quad (90-30deg), 30/15/15/15 at 80% occlusion\nReplace Hip Extension with Leg Press (shuttle), 30/15/15/15 at 80% occlusion\nHip Abduction, 30/15/15/15 at 80% occlusion\nTotal BFR time approximately 24 minutes per session with 2 sessions per week\n\nPhase 3- Weeks 5 to 6\n\nLong Arc Quad (90-30deg), 30/15/15/15 at 80% occlusion\nLeg Press (shuttle), 30/15/15/15 at 80% occlusion\nReplace Hip Abduction with Bilateral Hip Bridge, 30/15/15/15 at 80% occlusion\nTotal BFR time approximately 24 minutes per session, with 2 sessions per week\n\nPhase 4- Weeks 7 to 8\n\nLeg Press (shuttle), 30/15/15/15 at 80% occlusion\nReplace Long Arc Quad with Step Up 30/15/15/15 at 80% occlusion\nBilateral Hip Bridge, 30/15/15/15 at 80% occlusion\nTotal BFR time approximately 24 minutes per session, with 2 sessions per week\n\nPhase 5- Weeks 9 to 12\n\nReplace Bilateral Hip Bridge with Medial Step Down, 30/15/15/15 at 80% occlusion\nReplace Step up with Split Squat, 30/15/15/15 at 80% occlusion\nLeg Press (shuttle), 30/15/15/15 at 80% occlusion\nTotal BFR time approximately 24 minutes per session, with 2 sessions per week\n\nPhase 6- Weeks 11 to 12\n\nProgressively load exercises from phase 5\nTotal BFR time approximately 24 minutes per session, with 2 sessions per week"

          "Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs), constitute 10% of all pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Subjects with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas (DIPG) have a poor prognosis with a median survival that is usually reported to be 9 months, and nearly 90% of children die within 18 months from diagnosis. The mainstay of treatment is radiation to the primary tumor site. Surgical resection does not influence outcome and is often not feasible in this part of the central nervous system.\n\nMany promising drugs for central nervous system (CNS) disorders have failed to attain clinical success due to an intact blood brain barrier (BBB), limiting their access form the systemic circulation into the brain. Systemic administration of high doses may increase delivery to the brain, but this approach risks significant side effects and systemic toxicities. Direct delivery of the drugs to the brain by injection into the parenchyma bypasses the BBB, however, drug distribution form the site of injection tends to be limited. The convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of drugs describes the infusion of drugs under controlled pressure to the brain parenchyma via targeted microcatheter. This technique facilitates and deliver higher drug concentrations in brain tissue or tumor. The BBB can now operate to retain drug and to significantly reduce systemic side effects. In addition, the fact that panobinostat seems to be most efficacious clinically available drug against DIPG cells."

          "Handwriting is a functional skill underlying almost all academic performance of school-aged children, and handwriting impairment is highlighted by the World Health Organization as a barrier to school participation. The available evidence mentioned in the literature suggests handwriting skills are academically crucial, and handwriting deficits may lead to challenges in performing various academic activities both in and outside the classroom.\n\nGiven that children with TD are more likely to have handwriting deficits as suggested in a recent study, they are also more likely to have challenges in their academic performance and success as evidenced in the literature.\n\nIn the context of education, strong evidence indicated that handwriting has more cognitive and neurological benefits than using a keyboard when taking notes in the classroom. Therefore, reducing tics and improving handwriting skills rather than an adaptation approach using a word processor or computer may be the goal of intervention.\n\nResults of the investigator's previous study showed that children with Tourette Syndrome (TS) or tic disorders (TD) demonstrated handwriting deficits when compared to the general children population, and were consistent with a recent study conducted in France showing that children with TS exhibited handwriting problems. In addition to illegibility issues in handwriting as indicated by the low score on the Test of handwriting skills (THS-R), children with TS or TD also demonstrated writing deficits in the areas of speed of writing and correct letter case formation.\n\nSince handwriting deficit is an area of concern among children with TS or TD, one way to improve these children's handwriting skills is through handwriting practice. NeuroScript, LLC., has developed a software program (MovAlyzeR) that allows children to practice handwriting on an electronic device (such as tablet, laptop, etc). Given that the practice is completed on an electronic device with immediate feedback, this handwriting program may serve as a strong incentive to motivate children practicing handwriting. In order to provide evidence for the educators and therapists on the effectiveness of this software program, it is important to evaluate its effectiveness on improving handwriting skills among children with TS or TD."

          "A. Background and Purpose\n\nAcute neurologic injury (ANI) is an important and common cause of mortality and morbidity in pediatrics such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), stoke and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Advances have been made in the intensive care management of children with ANI improving mortality rates but survivors are often left with long-term neurologic and neuropsychological disabilities. It is estimated that as many as 50-60% of children who sustain a severe TBI will suffer from some long-term neurologic sequela such as cognitive, behavioral, psychiatric and psychological defects despite modern advanced care. Survivors of ANI may also sustain a reduction in their quality of life and ability to participate in daily activities and their long-term care can results in a considerable socioeconomic burden. The brain is a highly metabolic organ representing 2% of the total body weight but consuming 20% of the oxygen. The dependence of the brain on a high rate of aerobic cellular metabolism necessitates a continuous supply of oxygen and glucose. However, this large energy requirement also means that brain cells are particularly vulnerable to injury when nutrients are deprived even for very short periods. The delivery of cerebral energy nutrients is a highly controlled process maintained through an intricately balanced cerebrovascular system, which regulates cerebral blood flow (CBF) at a constant rate to meet tissue demand. In the simplest model CBF is proportional to the pressure differential across the cerebrovascular system and is inversely proportional to the cerebral vascular resistance (CVR). The driving pressure differential or cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) represents the vascular pressure difference across the brain tissue, expressed as the mean arterial pressure (MAP) minus the intracranial pressure (ICP).\n\nIn normal physiologic states CBF is largely independent of CPP over a wide range of pressure by altering CVR, a process known as cerebral autoregulation (CA). Cerebral autoregulation is controlled by the complex interplay of neurogenic, metabolic and myogenic mechanisms. During CA arterioles in the brain dilate (decreasing resistance) or constrict (increasing resistance) maintaining an adequate CBF to meet tissue metabolic demands (Figure 1). After ANI the endogenous autoregulatory mechanisms may be impaired predisposing vulnerable tissue to ischemia or vasogenic edema. In the normal state CA maintains a constant CBF over a wide rage of perfusion pressures but with loss of CA CBF becomes linear with perfusion pressure such that any reduction in CPP or MAP will cause a corresponding fall in blood flow. After severe TBI, cardiac arrest or spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage, children may suffer from a combination of cerebral and systemic pathophysiologic alterations such as hypotension, shock, cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, acute blood loss anemia and respiratory failure. Therefore, the biologic system of CA is a clinically important mechanism that functions to protect against cerebral hypoperfusion or hyperperfusion during the pathophysiologic changes that occur commonly in neurocritical illness where patients may have rapid changes in blood pressure, intracranial pressure or systemic oxygen delivery.\n\nCerebral blood flow is not directly measured at the bedside in clinical practice hence either CPP (if ICP is measured) or MAP is used to target an age-based goal in clinical practice. However, there are several limitations with this approach, 1) the optimal MAP/CPP threshold is unknown in children across age groups, 2) the optimal MAP/CPP value is very likely to not only be reflected by age-based target but be highly dependent on individual patient and injury-type factors and 3) due to this uncertainty there exists wide clinical variability is what value medical providers choose to target MAP/CPP after ANI. Moreover, since autoregulation is a continuous spectrum dependent on the adaptive response of CVR to regulate flow, disturbances may change over time and may also differ in the same patient with varying degrees of physiological derangement. Since CBF is not measured in clinical practice the actual ability of the patient to maintain an adequate CBF at a given MAP/CPP is assumed but not known. Relying on perfusion pressure alone fails to account for alterations in CA that occur after brain injury hindering the clinician's ability to determine if CBF is adequate to meet metabolic needs at a given MAP/CPP\n\nThere are emerging studies supporting the theory that impaired CA is an important factor in ANI. In adults impairments in CA are associated with a worse outcome and have been demonstrated to occur after a wide-spectrum of neurologic injuries, including TBI, HIE, subarachnoid hemorrhage and stroke.\n\nSimilar reports of poor outcomes after pediatric TBI and neonatal and pediatric HIE with have been found impaired in patients with impaired CA. However, significant knowledge gaps still exist in our current understanding of how to measure CA, which patients are at risk for impaired CA, if alterations in CA are associated with worse long-term functional outcomes and importantly how can the investigators use data from the patient's CA status to optimize our ICU management to improve outcomes. Current management options for children after severe TBI and intracranial hemorrhage may include the use of an invasive ICP monitor and arterial line to measure arterial blood pressure (ABP) and CPP continuously but these devices by themselves do not provide information about the status of the cerebrovascular system. Our study aims to utilizing two novel non-invasive methods of assessing dynamic autoregulation to describe the incidence and temporal profile of CA disturbances during the acute phase after ANI in children incorporating clinical data provided by the patient's current existing monitoring devices. The investigators also aim to examine the association between impaired CA and short and long-term functional neurologic outcome. This research proposal attempts to address some of our knowledge gaps in determination of CA disturbances and optimal MAP/CPP targets for children after ANI. The investigators hope this study will increase our understanding of CA impairments that occur after ANI and data gained from this study will lead to clinically useful tools incorporating CA assessment at the bedside to improve care for pediatric neurocritical care patients.\n\nMethods of Assessing Dynamic Cerebral Autoregulation Various methods have been previously studied to evaluate CA and currently there is no universally accepted method to assess the integrity of the cerebral autoregulation neurovascular system. Measurements of CA have been described in terms of a static or dynamic process. Static CA relates to the net change in CBF following the manipulation of ABP under steady state conditions typically with drugs that either increase or decrease blood pressure. In this method if CBF remained constant with changes in ABP, autoregulation is deemed to be intact. Dynamic CA describes the fast mechanisms that permit restoration of blood flow after rapid changes in ABP, which typically occur over longer periods of time. Traditional methods to study of CA use techniques such as vasopressor administration, squat maneuver, carotid compression and deflation of thigh cuffs to induce large fluctuation in blood pressure to measure the CBF response. However, these maneuvers rely on patient cooperation and may be unsuitable in cases of neurocritical illness. In the last decade, advances have been made in developing new methods to assess the dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) response by quantifying cross-correlation between spontaneous oscillations in MAP and CPP and the corresponding oscillations in CBF or oxygenation as opposed to experimental induced changes. While spontaneous oscillations in ABP and CBFv have been known to occur for many years, the function of these oscillations remain unknown. They are believed to originate as autonomic responses generated in the brainstem and peripheral baroreceptors. The cerebral arterioles response to changes in ABP may not be rapid enough to counteract high frequency changes hence fluctuations at these frequencies are passed along unmodified to cerebral circulation. In contrast, slower frequency oscillations (0.02 Hz to 0.2 Hz can be counteracted by cerebral arterioles to maintain constant flow. It is at these low frequency or slow waves periods that CA is believed to function as system to changes in ABP. Transfer function analysis and wavelet coherence analysis are mathematical models allowing simultaneous analysis of CA input and outputs over a wide range of physiologically relevant CA oscillatory frequencies. Measurements are interpreted based on the concept that dCA will work to minimize the effect of spontaneous oscillations in MAP on CBFv. Without a functional CA response each spontaneous oscillation in MAP would be associated with a similar oscillation in CBFv in terms of magnitude, duration and frequency. The investigators will combine two non-invasive techniques to investigate the temporal dCA relationship after ANI using spontaneous fluctuations of the patient's MAP or CPP as the input and CBFv or brain regional oxygenation as the output. Importantly, the two methods the investigators will be investigating utilize spontaneous fluctuations of a patient's physiologic waveforms. This eliminates the requirement for an experimental manipulation of blood pressure, which may introduce some risk to the patient. In the first method a 30-minute transcranial doppler (TCD) sonographic examination will be performed to analyze the transfer function analysis (TFA) of spontaneous oscillations of MAP/CPP and CBFv on days 1-10 after injury. In the second method, the investigators will examine dCA changes that occur continuously over the first 7-10 days of injury using a non-stationary model of wavelet coherence analysis between MAP/CPP and cerebral tissue oxygen saturation. In both models the investigators will be using MAP/CPP values measured from an indwelling arterial line placed as part of standard medical care.\n\nTransfer Function Analysis (TFA) Transfer function analysis is a mathematical model to describe the spontaneous fluctuations in MAP and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) which can analyze both static and dynamic components of CA. In the time-domain mean values of ABP and CBFv are obtained for each cardiac cycle and the spectral analysis algorithm Fast Fourier Transform is used to obtain spectral estimates in the frequency domain used to calculate coherence, gain and phase to describe the efficiency and latency of the CA frequency response across very low (VLF: 0.02-0.07 Hz), low (LF: 0.07-0.20 Hz), and high (HF: 0.20-0.50 Hz) frequency ranges. The analysis is based on the assumption that autoregulation functions in a \"stationary\" linear system with MAP considered the input and CBFv as the output. The analysis will be performed during a period of patient stability where no acute interventions will be made. Data acquisition settings and subsequent analysis for TFA will be in accordance with the white paper from the international cerebral autoregulation research network. A control group of patients will be enrolled as part of this study with arterial lines but without neurologic injury and have CBFv and TFA performed to serve as the comparison group.\n\nWavelet Coherence Analysis (WCA) Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive light emitting electrode method to measure regional tissue oxygenation. Probes sensitive to light absorption by oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb) can be placed directly on the skin of the forehead to measure cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO2) or the differential hemoglobin concentration (HbD = HbO2 - Hb). The SctO2 has been used as a non-invasive method to measure changes in regional cerebral perfusion or blood flow to assess CA. Spontaneous oscillations in CBF can therefore be estimated by changes in SctO2 values over time and analyzed against changes in MAP. Previous studies have used a linear correlation coefficient to analyze the relationship between SctO2 and MAP in adult and pediatric studies to assess dCA after cardiac surgery, subarachnoid hemorrhage and TBI. These prior analytical methods are based on the assumption of obtaining measurements in a stationary system, in other words the neurovascular and systemic hemodynamics do not change over time. In reality the investigators know that blood pressure and cerebral factors such as ICP and blood pressure are non-stationary, changing frequently, particularly in the early hours and days after critical illness. Wavelet coherence analysis assumes a non-stationary system and may be able to better characterize dCA disturbances in a continuous moving system during the real-time physiological changes that occur at the extremes of system stress not testable by previous methods. Wavelet coherence analysis can also be used to quantify the dynamic relationship between MAP and SctO2 across much longer time frames compared to TCD based analysis. Similar to TFA, wavelet coherence uses phase, gain and coherence to determine a relationship between the two waveforms values MAP/CPP and SctO2. Using NIRS-based SctO2 to measure changes in CBF has the advantages of being a stable sensor not subject to movement disturbances, a non-invasive routine monitor in the critical care unit and a method that requires no specialized training and is suitable for long-term continuous monitoring. A control group of patients will be enrolled as part of this study without neurologic injury but with arterial lines and NIRS monitoring to serve as the comparison group by having wavelet coherence analysis performed of MAP and SctO2 for 72 hours.\n\nB. Study Aims\n\nAim 1: Utilize transfer function analysis to analyze the cerebral autoregulation gain and phase values across very low (VLF: 0.02-0.07 Hz), low (LF: 0.07-0.20 Hz), and high (HF: 0.20-0.50 Hz) frequency ranges of MAP/CPP and CBFv after acute brain injury on post-injury days 1-10.\n\nAim 2: Utilize wavelet coherence analysis to analyze the coherence values of continuously measured MAP/CPP and regional cerebral oxygenation saturation across time and period domains during post-injury days 1-10 days in brain injured patients.\n\nAim 3: Assess the functional outcome of between patients who demonstrate disturbed cerebral autoregulation using hospital discharge, 3 and 6 months post-injury neurologic measurements.\n\nC. Study Design\n\nC.1 Concise Project Summary In this study, the investigators will use two non-invasive methods to investigate temporal changes in dynamic CA by performing cross-correlation analysis of spontaneous fluctuations in MAP/CPP with cerebral blood flow velocity and cerebral regional oxygenation domains to examine CA disturbances after acute pediatric acute neurologic injury. In the first method, the investigators will uses transfer function analysis of MAP/CPP and TCD-based CBFv waveforms to measure CA components gain and phase on post injury days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. This model assumes a stationary system as is performed for 30 minutes during a period of patient stability. In the second method, the investigators will utilize wavelet coherence analysis of MAP/CPP and NIRS-based tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) and to measure the continuous and dynamic CA changes occurring over a wide range of patient physiologic variables during the first 7-10 days after injury. This model allows for measurement of CA assuming a non-stationary system which more accurately reflects the actual pathophysiological and biologic disturbances that occurs in patients during the first days after neurocritical injury. For comparison with normal CA values, the investigators will use a control group of patients without any neurologic injury who are already intubated and sedated per standard of care. The study and control group will have arterial lines placed as part of their standard care to measure MAP for study analysis. The primary analyses will be conducted using two mathematical models of spontaneous oscillations in physiologic waveforms using continuous MAP/CPP as the CA input, and CBFv (TFA) or cerebral regional oxygenation (wavelet coherence) as the CA output. The investigators will also measure the impact that CA has on functional outcomes by measuring pediatric neurologic functional and disability scales at hospital discharge, 3, 6 and 12 months. Advancing our knowledge of the temporal changes that occur in CA during the initial critical phases of brain injury will lead to a better understanding of how the brain regulates flow after injury preventing secondary ischemia and help to develop patient-specific physiologic targets for MAP or CPP to optimize CBF accounting for the heterogeneity and individual differences in patients improving neurologic outcomes.\n\nC.2 Description of Infrastructure All study patients will be enrolled at Children's Medical Center Dallas. Data collection will be through both paper case report forms, review of the electronic medical record and direct subject data download from the bedside Phillips Intellivue monitor. Dr. Miles (PI) is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at UTSW Medical Center and has been an attending in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) since 2005. Dr. Miles will provide direct supervision for the research study and has experience in both TCD techniques and conducting clinical trials in the PICU. Dr. Miles currently has the following research equipment obtained for this study, 1) specialized portable workstation with personal computer, display and DWL transcranial doppler device for measurement of CBF velocities and simultaneous download of MAP and CBFv with Medicollector software, 2) additional PC and smaller workstation for continuous NIRS data for continuous Phillips monitor data capture with Medicollector software and 3) two specially designed sets of pediatric headpieces with portable TCD probes for measurement of 30 minute continuous TCD waveform. Wavelet coherence analysis of CA will be carried out in collaboration with Dr. Fenghua Tian Ph.D, a faculty member in the Department of Bioengineering at University of Texas at Arlington. Dr. Tian's research expertise includes the use of NIRS and noninvasive methods to measure CA and several publications using wavelet coherence investigating CA in neonates after HIE and children receiving extracorporeal support. Dr. Tian will also provide statistical analytical support. Transfer function analysis of CA will be carried out in collaboration with Dr. Sushmita Purkayastha, Assistant Professor in the Department of Applied Physiology and Health Management at Southern Methodist University. Dr. Purkayastha laboratory examines the link between clinical symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury and cerebral blood flow regulation. She is currently using similar methods of TFA to study changes in CA after concussion in college athletes and has published results in patients with stroke and white matter abnormalities. Laurence Ryan Ph.D. will provide computer-engineering support and statistical analysis creating a custom MatLab (Mathowrks, Natick, MA) software code for signal processing of waveform CBFv and MAP data into TFA frequency plots.\n\nC.3 Study Measures The study measures for aim 1 will be mean estimates of transfer function gain (cm/s/mmHg), phase (radians) and coherence for very low (VLF: 0.02-0.07 Hz), low (LF: 0.07-0.20 Hz), and high (HF: 0.20-0.50 Hz) frequency ranges calculated from MAP and CBFv spontaneous oscillations. Study measures for aim 2 study measures include calculation of squared cross-wavelet coherence (R2) ranging from 0-1 which represents the significance of correlations in spontaneous oscillations in MAP and SctO2 values during the first 7-10 days of injury. In this model an R2 value of 1 represent impaired autoregulation correlation where changes in MAP are significantly correlated with changes in cerebral oxygenation. A non-significant value would indicate spontaneous fluctuations in SctO2 are largely unconnected to changes in MAP. A squared cross-wavelet coherence threshold value of > 0.7 will be used for significance and will be plotted across patient monitoring time (X axis) and frequency or period (Y axis). In this model much lower frequency oscillations are being measured than for TFA for analysis ranging from 30 minutes to 256 minutes. The percentage of total monitoring time with significant cross-wavelet MAP and SctO2 coherence will be measured for each patient.\n\nC.4 Study Timeline Study activities will continue for a 3-year period or when a target enrollment of 35 subjects has been reached. Based on historical numbers of annual admission for severe TBI, stroke and HIE mechanisms in the PICU the investigators would anticipate reaching the study target within the study time frame with an consent refusal/missed eligibility rate of 20-40%. Given the non-invasive and observational nature of the study the investigators hope the consent rate will be high for this study. Including children with various types of acute neurologic injury should also contribute to reaching the target enrollment within the study time frame. Neurologic follow-up will continue for 12 months after hospital discharge from the last patient enrolled.\n\nD. Study Procedures\n\nD1. Transcranial Doppler Sonography Study team personnel will perform transcranial doppler (TCD) sonography on post-injury days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 to insonate the right and left middle cerebral artery mean, peak and diastolic flow velocities (cm/sec) via the temporal bone window. TCD uses ultrasound waves to measure the speed of moving blood in intracranial blood vessels. Since the blood flow velocity and vessel signal acquisition is very sensitive to probe movement, for continuous monitoring purposes a fixed probe device pediatric headpiece (LAM-Rack or Elastic Headband, DWL, Germany) will be used. This headpiece uses either a fixed metal frame or soft silicone straps to secure the TCD probes to the surface of the skull after the vessel signal is obtained. The headpiece has soft foam attachments and should not cause discomfort. Head circumference will be measured and using the standard 10 mm left and right of midline the middle cerebral artery/anterior cerebral artery (MCA/ACA) bifurcation will be identified first by a hand held probe where optimal insonation position will first be marked in the optimal position with a sharpie felt pen on the skin. This will allow for quicker and more consistent placement with the fixed headpiece for subsequent measurements. The investigators will use the mid MCA or most optimal signal for each patient but the same depth of MCA vessel will be used for repeated measurements. This procedure requires 20-30 minutes of continuous TCD measurements and the co-existing MAP waveform from an indwelling invasive arterial line connected to Phillips Intellivue patient care monitor. Readings will be collected during a period of patient stability where no acute medical interventions or ventilator changes are being made. Arterial blood pressure readings will be measured from an invasive arterial pressure transducer already placed for clinical monitoring of blood pressure. TCD measurements will be performed on a dedicated TCD machine (Doppler-BoxTM, Compumedics DWL, Germany) installed with QL imaging software and analogue TCD signal output capabilities. A specially designed portable computer cart style workstation consisting of the Doppler-Box, PC laptop and desktop computer, and 22-inch monitor is dedicated for use in research studies can be easily moved into any room in the critical care unit for bedside monitoring. While no adverse events have been reported in over 20 years experience of using TCD in the application of neurosonography, study patients may experience some stimulation with headpiece and probe placement. The investigators will attempt to minimize this as much as possible, if the patients physiological condition does not tolerate even mild movements with headpiece placement the investigators will stop the procedure.\n\nD2. Near Infrared Spectroscopy Cerebral Regional Oximetry Data for wavelet coherence will be collected continuously for the first 7-10 days of admission using the combined NIRS/MAP monitoring devices. Analyzing the changes in SctO2 with fluctuation in MAP/CPP continuously using wavelet coherence over first 7-10 days is important as this will uncover dynamic changes in CA that occur during the actual pathophysiologic disturbances at the margins of target values in neurocritical illness such as during periods of low MAP/CPP or elevated ICP Intracranial pressure (ICP). Cerebral oximetry values will be collected at 1 Hz from a NIRS monitor (Medtronic, INVOS 5100C Cerebral Oximetry, Minneapolis, MN). The NIRS self adhesive single-use sensor will be placed on a clean and dry site on the right/left or bilateral forehead above the eyebrow and inferior to hair line and away from any damaged tissue, sagittal sinus or frontal extra axial hemorrhages underlying the sensor. The skin around the sensor will be inspected twice daily and sensors will be kept away from strong light and moisture. Sensors will be removed if the patient is having an MRI but not if they are having a brain CT. If a patient will have NIRS as part of their standard of medical care the investigators will consent for collection of the SctO2 values that are being used by the clinical team for up to 10 days or as long as the monitor is in place. In patients where NIRS monitoring is not a standard of care device the NIRS sensor and monitor will be provided by the study team and the SctO2 value will be covered on the display during the study procedures. The medical team will be blinded to any TCD and/or SctO2 values if it is collected for the sole purposes of research. The screen is password protected and streaming data will not be available for viewing by the staff or family without a password to unlock the screen saver display.\n\nD3. Neurologic Outcome Assessment Neurologic outcome will be at assessed at hospital discharge, 3, 6 and 12 months post-injury. The 8-point Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended-Pediatrics (GOSEP) will be used for neurologic functional outcome categories. A GOSEP score of 1 = normal, 2 = mild disability, 3 = upper moderate disability, or 4 = lower moderate disability is classified as a favorable outcome. A GOSEP score of 5 = upper severe disability, 6 = lower severe disability, 7 = vegetative state, or 8 = death was classified is an unfavorable outcome. The GOSEP will be conducted by a study member through a 10-minute parent/legal guardian interview over the phone. Neuropsychological outcome will also be measured using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) a validated tool to measure domains of daily activities, mobility, social/cognitive function and responsibility from birth through 18 years. The PEDI-CAT is a computer based program which will be conducted over the phone with the interviewer reading questions and entering deidentified responses into the web based program for analysis and report."

          "Although pediatric cardiomyopathy is rare, the condition is severe and life-threatening. The main focus of this proposed study will examine whether insulin resistance is correlated with decreased cardiac function which will hopefully pave the way for future clinical trials using medications that sensitize insulin such as metformin or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1 agonists) as possible therapeutic agents. The exploratory piece of this study will investigate a novel therapeutic target by determining whether FGF21 has any direct effects on cardiac function and whether it interacts with insulin resistance in altering cardiac function. Patients with cardiomyopathy normally undergo ECHO as part of routine evaluation and follow up and is standard of care. At this time, there are no official guidelines for pediatric patients with cardiomyopathy to undergo oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) and thus it is not part of the standard of care. Based on findings from this study, the investigators hope to justify performing an OGTT on pediatric patients with dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and incorporate the procedure in future practice guidelines."

          "Pectus excavatum is the most common chest wall deformity in children, accounting for 90% of all congenital chest wall deformities. It occurs in one to eight per 1000 live births. The severity of the pectus deformity may become more noticeable during pubertal growth spurs and repair is therefore usually performed in the teenage years. A common operative procedure to repair a pectus deformity is the minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE). The MIRPE involves the substernal placement of a contoured metal bar secured to the lateral aspect of the ribs. This metal bar allows for correction of the concave deformity by applying constant outward pressure to the underside of the sternum. Although the cosmetic results are excellent, patients do report significant pain from the constant pressure exerted on the chest wall from the metal bar. Pain management approaches tend to differ on both the provider and institutional level. There is a lack of evidence regarding which postoperative analgesia method is best. To address this research gap, this proposal aims to conduct a randomized controlled trail using the three most commonly used methods; 1) patient controlled analgesia (PCA); 2) erector spinae blocks (ESB) with continuous infusion pumps; and 3) video-assisted intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC)."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Pectus excavatum deformity is a common condition in a pediatric surgical practice. While MIRPE provides excellent cosmetic results and is associated with shorter operative time and lower intraoperative blood loss, the immediate correction of the concave deformity with a metal bar places patients in a difficult pain control situation. While multiple postoperative analgesia modalities have been studied, there is still a need for a large, prospective, randomized trial that is appropriately powered to evaluate the best pain control modality after MIRPE. Of the clinically appropriate interventions, ESB and INC have been shown to have comparable LOS after the operation, especially when employed as part of an enhanced recovery pathway (ERP) bundle. Comparing these newer analgesia modalities to the more established PCA approach may help identify the most effective postoperative pain control approach that maximizes the safety profile while minimizing the use of narcotic pain medications after MIRPE.\n\nThe investigators propose a prospective randomized trial evaluating the effectiveness of INC, PCA and ESB with continuous local anesthetic infusion via a pain pump delivery system. All groups will follow a multimodal enhanced recovery pathway. Groups will different only in the use of INC, PCA, or ESB.\n\nSince previous studies have reported similarly short LOS for both ESB and INC, but no prospective, direct comparisons of these techniques have been done, we believe comparing these two groups to the more established PCA modality will further advance the field of post MIRPE pain management by providing precise estimates of length of stay (LOS), hospital resource utilization, and other important outcomes that have not received sufficient attention including pain, quality of life, resumption of activities of daily living, and a rigorous survey for potential adverse outcomes. The investigators specifically hypothesize that because of the long-term analgesia of up to 2-3 months, the INC group may experience not only shorter LOS but decreased narcotic use than the ESB and PCA groups, and also improved quality of life, with fewer encounters in the postoperative period (30 days) for pain related concerns."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is the most common cause of recurrent and persistent hypoglycemia, presenting early in infancy. Patients who fail medical therapy usually require resection of the diseased pancreas(partial or subtotal pancreatectomy) to control this disorder. Over half of patients undergoing surgery have a focal area of islet cell dysfunction that is curable with resection. These focal lesions are areas of adenomatosis consisting of a clone of beta-cells that express a paternally-derived mutation of the KATP channel due to loss of heterozygosity for the maternal allele. Current imaging techniques cannot differentiate focal and diffuse forms of hyperinsulinism, nor can they locate focal areas of disease within the pancreas before surgery. L-DOPA is taken up by some neuroendocrine cells, including pancreatic islet cells, and stored as dopamine in secretory granules. Recent studies show that positron emission tomography (PET) following administration of 18F-fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA) can distinguish focal and diffuse forms of HI and accurately locate focal lesions within the pancreas."

        "BriefSummary": [
          "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the current leading cause of disability worldwide and adolescence is an especially vulnerable period for the onset of depression. Non-pharmacologic approaches are particularly attractive as treatment of adolescent depression due to the elevated risks of side effects related to the use of psychotropic drugs during development. A recent meta-analysis detected a positive and significant effect of non-deceptive placebos (open-label placebo, OLP) for a series of clinical conditions, including adult depression. To the investigators' knowledge, no studies of OLP have been conducted in depressed adolescents to date, although placebo response rates in adolescent depression are especially high, accounting for over 80% of the actual response to antidepressant treatment. The study's main objective is to estimate the effectiveness and understand the mechanism of OLP in depressed adolescents. The central hypothesis is that the mechanism by which OLP exerts its action in adolescent depression is by forming a positive expectation, which activates endogenous mu-opioid receptor (MOR)-mediated neurotransmission in a network of regions implicated in emotion, stress regulation, and the pathophysiology of MDD, namely, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) - striato - amygdalo - thalamic network. The hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of published research and preliminary data. The investigators will test the hypothesis by performing structural and functional neuroimaging in 60 untreated 13-18 year-old adolescents with mild to moderate depression. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to elucidate the mechanism of action of OLP and advance the understanding of the neural underpinnings of positive expectations in adolescent depression."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "This is a randomized controlled study to investigate non-deceptive placebos (open-label placebo, OLP) in depressed adolescents. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: OLP with the 4-point rationale group (n=20), OLP without rationale group (n=20), and controls (n=20) who will receive the same level of supportive attention from the study clinician. MRI scanning and clinical assessments will be performed at the baseline and after the 2-week treatment or waiting period. The main objective here is to estimate the effectiveness and understand the mechanism of OLP in depressed adolescents. The central hypothesis is that the mechanism by which OLP exerts its action in adolescent depression is by forming a positive expectation, which activates endogenous mu-opioid receptor (MOR)-mediated neurotransmission in a network of regions implicated in emotion, stress regulation, and the pathophysiology of depression, namely, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) - striato - amygdalo - thalamic network. The investigators plan to test the central hypothesis in 60 13-18 year-old adolescents with mild to moderate depression by pursuing the following Aims:\n\nAIM 1: To test the effectiveness of OLP in depressed adolescents. Depressed adolescents will be randomly assigned for two weeks to an OLP with the 4-point rationale group (n=20), OLP without rationale group (n=20), and controls (n=20) who will receive the same level of supportive attention from the study clinician. Hypothesis 1: The improvement in depression symptoms measured by the self-report Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS-2) in the OLP + rationale group (that combines conscious positive expectation with conditioned response to the ingestion of medication) will be higher than in the OLP without rationale group (conditioned response only) and controls. Positive expectation of recovery will be assessed before and after group assignment and accounted for in the analyses.\n\nAIM 2: To measure neural response to OLP. The OLP groups will receive the first dose of the OLP in the MRI scanner and changes in the cerebral blood perfusion (CBP) will be measured using arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI. Mechanistically, the investigators expect that the MOR-mediated neurotransmission activated by placebo will be associated with a CBP increase, specifically: Hypothesis 2a: The CBP increase in the ACC - striato - amygdalo - thalamic network after the administration of the OLP + rationale to be higher than in the OLP group and controls. Hypothesis 2b: This CBP increase will correlate with the improvement in RADS-2 scores after two weeks.\n\nAIM 3: To test neural network normalization in depressed adolescents (by comparing to the existing database of MRI scans of healthy teens). The second MRI will be performed after the two weeks. Mechanistically, the investigators expect that through the regular activation by OLP, myelination of the ACC - striato - amygdalo - thalamic network will increase, leading to a normalization of the previously demonstrated hypoconnectivity. Hypothesis 3: The increases in structural and functional connectivity of the ACC - striato - amygdalo - thalamic network after two weeks will correlate with decreases in RADS-2 depression total scores."

The overall objectives of this application are to prospectively (1) determine if a prescribed exercise program initiated within the first week of mild traumatic brain injury can reduce the risk of developing persistent post-concussion symptoms and (2) examine the effects of an exercise program on psychosocial, sleep, and pain outcomes when initiated within 7 days of injury and continued for two months. The investigators will address these objectives by testing the central hypotheses that those assigned to an exercise intervention will have lower risk of developing persistent post-concussion symptoms and will report lower anxiety, depression, and pain interference ratings, higher peer relationship ratings, and better sleep quality ratings compared to usual care. In order to achieve this, the investigators will use a block stratified randomized intervention design. Block stratified randomization procedures will be conducted according to standard procedures so that sample numbers are equally assigned to each group, selected due to the relatively small sample size of the proposed study. Participants will be identified, enrolled, and assessed within 5 days of mild traumatic brain injury, randomized to an exercise intervention or usual care group 3-7 days after mild traumatic brain injury, and follow-up with in person assessments at approximately one and two months post-injury."

Those randomized to the Intervention arm will receive a one-on-one counseling session and access to an individually tailored multi-media website. Key intervention components will be reinforced through text messaging to aid goal setting, a physical activity tracker (Fitbit) to set goals, track and log activity, and access to a study Instagram account to reinforce exposure to web content. The primary outcome will be increases in moderate-to-vigorous activity between baseline and 6 months. Secondary outcomes will include changes in activity at 12 months, potential mediators of the intervention, costs of delivering the intervention, behavior change trajectories from continuous data from Fitbits, potential moderators, and changes in physiological and psychological variables."

          "Latina adolescents report low levels of physical activity, with only 3% meeting national physical activity guidelines, and are at high lifetime risk for conditions related to inactivity, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. Interventions grounded in sound psychosocial theory and leveraging growing technology use in Latina adolescents are needed to reverse patterns of inactivity, establish healthy lifetime habits and reduce widening disparities. The research team has developed and tested individually tailored, culturally adapted web-based interventions to increase moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) for Latinos, which significantly increased MVPA in adult Latino men and women. In a recent pilot study (R03NR014329), this intervention was adapted based on formative interviews to make it appropriate for Latina adolescents and tested it in a single-arm pilot trial (N=21). After 12 weeks, retention was high (90.5%) and self-reported MVPA increased from 24.7(26.11) minutes/week at baseline to 79.4(46.8) at follow up (p<0.001), suggesting good potential efficacy. In closeout interviews, girls expressed a preference to increase audiovideo components of the website and to incorporate other mobile-health technologies, such as texting, smartphone apps, social media, and wearables. Thus, the aim of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (N=200) of an individually tailored, theory-based, multi-technology intervention to increase MVPA in Latina adolescents. The intervention will comprise a counseling session to teach behavior change techniques, an interactive multimedia website with individually tailored content based on principles of the Transtheoretical Model and Social Cognitive Theory, a wearable tracker and smartphone app to reinforce key behavior change techniques, connection with a study Instagram account to reinforce exposure to intervention content, and automated text messages guide continued goal setting. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention or only a wearable tracker with smartphone app. Activity will be measured at baseline and six-month follow-up using well-established MVPA measures (accelerometers and the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall Interview). It is hypothesized that those randomized to receive the intervention will show significantly greater increases in MVPA at six months than those in the control group. The investigators will also evaluate whether changes in MVPA are mediated by changes in targeted psychosocial constructs (e.g. self-efficacy, social support) or engagement with technology, assess longer-term changes in MVPA at 12 months, and evaluate whether intervention effects are moderated by baseline personal and environmental variables (e.g. age, BMI, neighborhood environment). Costs to deliver the intervention (e.g. staff time, materials, overhead) will be tracked to evaluate costs and cost-effectiveness of both study arms, and the investigators will track contact time to assess whether staff contact is related to study outcomes. The investigators will also explore trajectories of daily activity in both the intervention and control groups using continuous data from wearable trackers. The proposed study will promote a critical preventive health behavior, physical activity, in Latina adolescents using technologies that are pervasive in this high risk, quickly growing population and highly scalable, laying the groundwork for cost-effective, broad reaching interventions with great potential for preventing chronic disease and promoting health and wellbeing throughout the lifespan."

          "Unexplained heterogeneity in outcomes following pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most critical barriers to the development of effective prognostic tools and therapeutics. The addition of personal biological factors to our prediction models may account for a significant portion of unexplained variance and advance the field towards precision rehabilitation medicine. The overarching goal of the Epigenetic Effects on Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury Recovery (EETR) study is to investigate an epigenetic biomarker involved in both childhood adversity and post-injury neuroplasticity to better understand heterogeneity in neurobehavioral outcomes following pediatric TBI. The primary hypothesis is that childhood adversity will be associated with poorer neurobehavioral recovery in part through an epigenetically mediated reduction in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in response to TBI.\n\nEETR is an observational, prospective, longitudinal concurrent cohort study of children aged 3-18 years with either TBI (n=200) or orthopedic injury (n=100), recruited from the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Participants complete study visits acutely and at 6- and 12-months post-injury. Blood and saliva biosamples are collected at all time points-and CSF when available acutely-for epigenetic and proteomic analysis of BDNF. Additional measures assess injury characteristics, pre- and post-injury child neurobehavioral functioning, childhood adversity, and potential covariates/confounders. Analyses will characterize BDNF DNA methylation and protein levels over the recovery period and investigate this novel biomarker as a potential biological mechanism underlying the known association between childhood adversity and poorer neurobehavioral outcomes following pediatric TBI."

          "Capacity Builders (CBI) will implement the Youth Builders PREIS curriculum Native STAND, recruiting Navajo youth in grades 9-11 and between the ages 14-18 who attend school in the Consolidated School District in New Mexico. Using the Theory of Reasoned Action as a theoretical framework, the curriculum will be administered in classrooms over 27 sessions lasting 45 minutes. The curriculum will entail lessons conducted in either Physical Education or Health Classes and youth will be randomly assigned to two groups by the local program evaluator. Youth will be required to obtain signed consent and assent forms prior to participating in the intervention program. Youth will complete pre and post surveys to measure program outcomes. Random assignment will be conducted for the impact and comparison groups by being placed into a pool; students will be blindly pulled to become the impact group. Groups will be stratified to ensure balance between treatment and comparison groups. Quarterly evaluation reports (QERs) and an annual evaluation report will be provided to the Action Team for review.\n\nCapacity Builder's Inc. (CBI) Youth Builders PREIS program seeks to test a modification of the Native STAND curriculum in Northwest New Mexico with at least 834 Navajo teens and 3 cohorts. The curriculum is intended to reduce pregnancies, births, and STI's including HIV/AIDS among high-risk youth populations by implementing culturally sensitive curriculum based on Navajo positive youth development. Additional curriculum of adulthood preparation subjects will increase participant knowledge in the areas of: healthy relationships, adolescent development, communication skills, healthy life skills. Youth Builders will be delivered within the traditional school day, embedded into regularly scheduled learning time. Presented once each week for 27 weeks over a 36-week school year, Youth Builders will reach students where they are, overcoming many challenges associated with retention. The project will support a Randomized Controlled Experimental Design. CBI will create valuable resources to support Youth Builders replication nationwide, including a comprehensive Youth Builders Blueprint, describing all action steps taken to achieve goals and objectives. In addition to action steps, the Youth Builders Blueprint will include: program curriculum; curricular map; training materials; sample parent consent forms; sample referral procedures / policies; staff training schedules; sample partnership agreements; Action Team meeting minutes,QERs, and annual evaluation reports The Youth Builders Blueprint will be available in both print and online format, and will be widely disseminated throughout the CBI network of non-profit agencies, Tribes, and school districts across the United States. Conference presentation will be ongoing at state and national conferences."

          "One of the challenges in pediatric anesthesiology is to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion pressure to prevent cerebral ischemia or hyperemia from pressure-passive perfusion. However, there is no optimal tool for longitudinally monitoring cerebral perfusion under general anesthesia (GA). In addition, the safe limits of blood pressure that maintains adequate cerebral perfusion in infants and children are not clear. Furthermore, patients with neurological impairments may have impaired cerebral auto-regulation (CA) function which may associated with functional outcomes. To address the critical public health issues associated with the safe use of general anesthesia in during neurosurgery, monitoring cerebral perfusion and oxygenation continuously during the peri-operative period.\n\nThe investigators have pioneered a novel technology, diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS), to optically measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) non-invasively and demonstrated that it is safe and practical as a bedside CBF monitor in the NICU. Blood flow is distinct from blood oxygenation, but both are important for brain health. Clinical near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) devices are available to monitor oxygenation by light absorption, but CBF must be monitored by light scattering, which is only available with research DCS devices. While the physical principles of the methods are different, the sensors for both techniques are very similar. The investigators have therefore combined DCS with advanced frequency-domain NIRS (FDNIRS) in a single device to simultaneously monitor cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (cStO2), blood volume (CBV), CBF and oxygen metabolism (CMRO2), which cannot be monitored with existing clinical devices. The investigators have previously shown that these measures are far more sensitive than cStO2 alone in several infant brain pathologies. In this study, the investigators aim to test the feasibility of integrating the FDNIRS-DCS technology into perioperative monitoring to study cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism continuously in children during general anesthesia and surgery. Additionally, the investigators will determine how anesthesia-related events affect cerebral hemodynamic instability and how anesthetic level correlates with CA functions in children."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is a mechanism that maintains cerebral flood flow (CBF) despite the fluctuations in the arterial blood pressure. This process protects the brain from ischemic or hemorrhagic insults during events of hypo- or hyperperfusion, respectively. Children under general anesthesia (GA) are particularly vulnerable to these events because anesthetic agents profoundly impact cerebral metabolic supply and demand. At the same time, to varying degrees, anesthetic agents can compromise respiration, produce hypotension, and even inhibit cerebral autoregulation function. General anesthesia-induced cerebral hypoperfusion can occur during routine GA and is associated with deleterious neurological outcomes in children. Thus, primary goals in managing GA are therefore to maintain adequate hemodynamics and cerebral perfusion under intact CA.\n\nA recent large retrospective study demonstrated that blood pressure ranges in anesthetized children are significantly lower than in awake, healthy children. However, the safe limits of blood pressure that maintains adequate cerebral perfusion in infants and children are not clear and my vary depending on the age and disease severity. Currently, bedside CBF monitoring had been impractical. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) is the only clinically available tool to measure cerebral blood flow velocity in larger arteries. Although TCD has been used for obtaining cerebral hemodynamics including autoregulation for clinical use, it is not practical for long-term monitoring due to the difficulty to secure the probe on the patient's head. Furthermore, the accuracy of the TCD measurement is highly operator-dependent which impedes its general use.\n\nCerebral oximeters, based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) have become popular means of assessing cerebral hemoglobin oxygen saturation (cStO2) during GA, but its use has not become routine. Clinically relevant desaturation (generally below 50-60 percent) implies a mismatch between brain oxygen supply and demand. When presenting persistently, they can serve as an intraoperative warning sign of hemodynamic and metabolic comprise. A recent study with 453 healthy infants undergoing general anesthesia for non-cardiac surgery found the episodes of desaturation is rare (2%) despite that critically low blood pressure (MAP <35 mmHg) was observed in almost 40% of subjects. Because desaturation events are relatively rare, they are unlikely to be responsible for adverse outcomes in non-cardiac surgery. However, the magnitude of the change in cStO2 from the awake to anesthetized state was associated with the range of MAP experienced during GA, suggesting systematic changes in cerebral perfusion may be more important than desaturation events for assessing hemodynamic risk.\n\nTo address the critical public health issues associated with the safe use of anesthesia in children, the investigators propose to develop new beside tools to monitor cerebral hemodynamics and perfusion continuously during anesthesia. The investigators aim to quantify cStO2, CBF, CMRO2, and its coupling relationship in children with and without neurologic impairments while awake and during different phases of GA (aim1). With continuous measures of arterial blood pressure, the investigators will further determine CA functions by studying the relationship between CBF and ABP simultaneously with anesthesia-related physiological events, including hypercapnia (aim2). Ultimately, the investigators aim to integrate our technology into perioperative monitoring to enable age-appropriate, goal-directed cerebral hemodynamic management to spare infant brains from the potentially deleterious effects of anesthesia."

This study proposes to monitor SCD and its treatment through their impact on cerebral hemodynamics, as the brain is one of the most vulnerable and consequential targets of the disease. Specifically, this study will optimize quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and advanced optical spectroscopy techniques such as frequency-domain near-infrared and diffuse correlation spectroscopies (FDNIRS-DCS) to monitor 1) cerebral oxygen transport with measures of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) and 2) endothelial function with cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR).\n\nAdditionally, this study aims to monitor baseline cerebral oxygen transport and CVR, as well as changes that occur with treatment (transfusion or genetic therapy to induce fetal hemoglobin) and assess hemoglobinopathy patients with known genotypes and phenotypes. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate the potential of this monitoring approach to select individual SCD subjects for interventions and evaluate individual responses to treatment. Success will help justify inclusion of these modalities in ongoing and future clinical trials of novel SCD therapies."

          "Prostate cancer is a hormonally-driven disease and androgens are key in the growth of both normal prostate and prostate cancer cells. Once mCRPC is evident, most patients receive a second-generation hormonal therapy to further suppress the synthesis or androgens (abiraterone) and to block androgen receptor (AR) activation, nuclear translocation and DNA binding (enzalutamide).\n\nConventional imaging of prostate cancer has limitations in staging, restaging after biochemical relapse, and response assessment. Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) can target various aspects of tumor biology and is clearly superior in the detection of extra-prostatic disease. 18F-fluciclovine is a synthetic amino acid transported across mammalian cell membranes by amino acid transporters that are upregulated in prostate cancer cells.\n\n18F-fluciclovine is approved for PET imaging to identify sites of prostate cancer recurrence in men with rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) following prior definitive treatment. This study describes the changes in 18F-fluciclovine PET scan and compare these results with PSA and conventional computerized tomography (CT) and bone scans, in mCRPC patients treated with abiraterone acetate-prednisone, enzalutamide or docetaxel."

Findings from this study may help create treatments to delay or prevent some of the negative effects of IR on cognitive and vascular health."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Insulin resistance (IR), a hallmark of metabolic syndrome and diabetes, is strongly linked to numerous health disorders, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. In adults, data indicate IR negatively impacts brain structure and function, such as decreased regional brain volumes, increased white matter hyperintensities, and poorer memory and attention, all of which are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. In parallel with data from adults, emerging data from adolescents with IR suggest similar brain structural and functional changes. Importantly, these changes occur during a critical period for proper brain development and maturation, thus having a potentially fateful impact on these young brains as they mature into adulthood.\n\nIn addition to brain structural and cognitive changes, IR is also associated with lower cerebral blood flow (CBF), which is linked to neurocognitive problems in adults. The consequences of IR on cerebrovascular dysfunction- and its interaction with neurocognition- in adolescents remain largely unexplored. Therefore, impaired vascular function may hold tremendous influence over brain health in adolescents at a vital period in brain development.\n\nExercise is a key factor in treating IR from a metabolic perspective, and acts as the only effective intervention known to combat dementia-related diseases in adults. Furthermore, exercise can acutely increase cognitive abilities and CBF, and adults with higher aerobic fitness demonstrate greater CBF, and CBF is increased following exercise training. With this as background, a few questions emerge regarding adolescents with IR: is there a dose-response relationship between IR severity and cognitive function? Can exercise improve cognition and impact brain health? What is the role of vascular function in cognition on potential exercise-induced improvements?\n\nThe long-term goal of this research program is to determine the influence of IR, physical activity, and their interaction on brain development in adolescents by interrogating the relationships between neurocognition, brain structure, and underlying mechanisms. The primary goal of the current pilot project is to quantify neurocognitive function in relation to the severity of IR and use acute exercise as a tool to improve function. The central hypothesis is that as IR worsens: 1) subtle neurocognitive abnormalities worsen, 2) exercise-mediated improvements in neurocognitive function are blunted, due in part to 3) reduced CBF responses.\n\nParticipants will be recruited primarily from pediatric and pediatric endocrinology clinics via our collaborator, Dr. Aaron Carrel, and his staff in UWHC Pediatric Endocrinology. Additionally, participants will be recruited from the greater Madison, WI community."

          "Providing effective analgesia after spinal fusion for idiopathic scoliosis remains a challenge with significant practice variation existing among high volume spine surgery centers. Even in the era of multimodal analgesia, opioids are the primary analgesics used for pain control after pediatric scoliosis surgery, but have multiple known adverse effects. The erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a newly described fascial plane block performed by injecting local anesthetic between the erector spinae muscle and the transverse process. Additionally, there are case reports describing the ESPB as part of a multi-modal analgesic plan in adult degenerative spine surgery as well as adult spinal deformity surgery, demonstrating effective analgesia and no clinical motor blockade. Although it is known that the inflammatory reaction plays a crucial role in the mechanism of acute pain after major surgery, the effectiveness of the current regional approach on inflammatory response is not well studied."

          "Energy intake (EI) is an important predictor of weight gain (1) and accurate methods to measure children's and adolescent's EI are needed. Self-report methods (e.g., 24-hour recall and food records) have their strengths and are frequently used to measure children's EI. Nonetheless, they also have significant limitations, including participant and caregiver burden and lack of near real-time data.\n\nOur group developed the Remote Food Photography Method (RFPM) to measure the EI of adults in near real-time and the validity data in adults are exceptional; the RFPM underestimates EI in laboratory settings by less than 6% and in free-living conditions by less than 7% compared to weighed foods and by less than 4% compared to doubly labeled water (DLW) over 6 days. At the same time, participant burden is drastically reduced compared to self-report methods, as participants are only required to capture images of their food selection and plate waste with a smartphone app and send these images to the laboratory for analysis. This validation study aims to assess the accuracy of the RFPM and SmartIntake app in a sample of adolescents in free-living conditions."

The CBT intervention involves 4 primary components: psychoeducation, activity management, sleep hygiene, and relaxation training (adapted from McNally et al., 2018). Psychoeducation involves providing patients and families with information about typical concussion symptoms and recovery, the role of non-injury/psychological factors in post-concussion syndrome, and information about the mind-body connection. Activity management involves setting specific goals to achieve a return to normal daily activities such as school attendance, schoolwork completion, household activities, and participating in social/leisure activities. The sleep hygiene component involves providing individualized recommendations to promote healthy sleep habits such as eliminating naps, keeping a consistent sleep schedule, turning off electronics at bedtime, or other needed modifications. Finally, relaxation training involves teaching specific evidence-based strategies for relaxation and coping with stress such as diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation."

          "The neural basis underlying motor performance in children using a prosthesis has been severely understudied resulting in minimal empirical evidence. The use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in conjunction with customized and visually appealing 3D printed prostheses would provide the unique opportunity to quantitatively assess the influence of upper-limb prostheses in the neural activation patterns of the primary motor cortex and motor performance of children. This information would increase the investigators limited knowledge of how prosthesis usage influences the primary motor cortex of growing children and use this information to develop rehabilitation programs aimed at reducing prosthesis rejection and abandonment."

          "The investigators anticipate enrolling a total of 40 children between 3 and 18 years of age. Specifically, two groups of children will be recruited; children with unilateral congenital upper-limb reductions (n=20) and age and sex-matched control group of typically developing children (n=20). Considering the effect size from preliminary data and to account for a 10% drop-out rate, a total sample of 40 subjects will provide 80% power to detect a true standardized effect size.\n\nParticipants will be asked to attend a total of 3 sessions. Participants will attend an initial measurement session to take a 3D scan of the affected and non-affected upper limbs as well as several anthropometric measurements. During this session, three pictures of the upper limbs will be taken which will also be used to verify the fit the prostheses in a process previously validated by our research team. The research participants will then be asked to come for two testing visits. During the first testing visit (visit 1), participants will be fitted with the prosthesis and required adjustments to improve comfort and avoid pressure point will be performed. After fitting the prosthesis, participants will be given 15 minutes to explore the prosthesis and adjust the tensioner dial to regulate the opening of the fingers to perform the Box and Block Test. After the training and accommodation period, participants will be asked to perform 3 trials of flexion and extension of each wrist with and without the prosthesis and 3 different trials of the Box and Blocks Test for each hand while monitoring neural activity of the primary motor cortex using a fNIRS device. After a period of 20 minutes rest, participants will be asked to perform three trials of a bimanual coordination test using an instrumented tray. The bimanual task will require participants to start from a standard position and then reach forward and grasp (hand-to-tray), transport and place a tray on a ledge (tray transport), and then return the hands to the starting position (hand return). This task will be performed unimanually (3 trials for each hand) and bimanually (3 trials using both hands). Eight weeks after the baseline measurements, participants will be asked to visit our laboratory for a second time and perform the same assessments. Between the testing visits, participants will be encouraged to use the prosthesis for a minimum of 2 hours a day. In addition, an occupational therapy student will perform 3 home visits a week and will direct a training protocol that consists of completing three trials of a series of 6 block building activities for each hand separated by 30 seconds of rest (a total of 18 block building activities per hand). All participants including the control group will perform the same training protocol."

        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Children with ADHD are at elevated risk for depression in adolescence and young adulthood, and this comorbidity is associated with far greater impairment than either disorder alone, including higher rates of inpatient hospitalization and increased risk for suicidal ideation and behavior. Despite these adverse outcomes, existing evidence-based interventions for ADHD have not demonstrated effects in reducing depressive symptoms nor do established depression prevention programs work as well for adolescents with ADHD. Reward responsivity (RR) and emotion regulation (ER) are two key factors demonstrated to mediate the association between ADHD and depression and are thus key targets for prevention. In an effort to address the gap between access and utilization of mental health care, which is especially stark among adolescents with ADHD, we aim to develop and test a modified behavioral activation prevention program [Behaviorally Enhancing Adolescents' Mood in Schools (BEAM-S)] that incorporates modules to directly target these purported mechanisms. In line with the Deployment-Focused Model of Intervention Development and Testing, we will develop a program that can be easily implemented and sustainable in the high school setting as delivered by school mental health staff that reduces depression and improves overall functioning in adolescents with ADHD, by way of improving RR and ER. As a first step, we will conduct focus groups with community stakeholders (e.g., school mental health providers, school administration, adolescents, parents, teachers) to develop an acceptable and sustainable selected and indicated prevention program for school staff to utilize. We will then initially train school staff to deliver this prevention program via to pilot the intervention for implementation of the prevention program in a case series to evaluate preliminary feasibility. We will then conduct a stage 1 RCT with a hybrid-type 1 implementation effectiveness design in three high schools where adolescents will be randomized to either the BEAM-S condition (n= 54) or treatment as usual (n = 54). Finally, qualitative and quantitative data from aims 1-3 will be used to prepare final procedures for a future large-scale effectiveness trial R01 (aim 4)."

          "The knowledge of right ventricular (RV) volumes is important from a clinical prospective. Traditionally, these volumes have been measured by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) because of its accuracy, reproducibility, and freedom from geometric assumptions. More and more, however, 3D echo has been used for assessment of ventricular volumes, first for left ventricle, now increasingly for RV. Most publication are basing RV volumes on images acquired from the apical window. However, some data have called the practice of basing these images on apical window into question. Moreover, despite our best efforts, we have been unable, in our laboratory to reliably visualize RV outflow from the apical view. An alternative view that can be used for RV 3D volume acquisition (first pioneered at BCH) is the subcostal view. Therefore, we plan to conduct a head-to-head comparison of RV volumes acquired from these two windows (apical and subcostal), with comparison to gold-standard CMR.\n\nHypothesis: RVEDV measured by the subcostal window is more accurate than RV volume measured in the apical window in a cohort of pediatric patients.\n\nAnalytic plan: Echocardiograms will be performed on the same day as the CMR, and will be performed by a group of sonographers trained in 3D volume acquisition. Descriptive statistics will include mean and median absolute % error and coefficients of variation. A paired t-test will be used to compare raw differences in %error for apical vs. subcostal window measurements. If the %error is highly skewed, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used or the %error values will be log-transformed before application of the paired t-test (if no zero %error values exist). Linear regression will be used to estimate the window-differences in %error or log(%error) controlling for age and/or sedation status. Assessments of feasibility for both windows will be performed as described by Renella et al; and reproducibility of measurements made with echo vs. CMR will be also be graphically assessed using Bland-Altman plots of the raw measurements for data derived from each window. As a secondary (stratified) analysis, we anticipate dividing the cohort into 2 groups of 25 patients each (25 < 10y; 25 > 10y). Patients under 10y will typically be under anesthesia. Exploratory analyses will investigate subgroup differences defined by demographic/ surgical variables with respect to the magnitude of the difference between the 2 techniques. Of note the analyses performed above will also be performed for LV (in addition to RV) as a secondary analysis (with comparison of LV-specific vs. non-LV specific software, as appropriate).\n\nSample size/Power: funding is provided for 50 patients and this will be our target sample size. The analysis will be paired, to compare the %error (echo relative to MRI) measurements from apical vs. subcostal windows). To detect a 0.5 SD difference in apical vs. subcostal windows %error with 85% power, 38 subjects with echo & MRI are required. If the comparisons are performed stratified by age (25 subjects per age group), there is 80% power to detect a 0.58 SD difference in apical vs. subcostal windows %error.\n\nLimitations: CMR, while considered a gold-standard, has a certain amount of intrinsic variability in volume measurement. Moreover, a statistically significant difference may not necessary be a clinically important difference. Patients will not have echo and CMR performed at the exact same time."

          "This study is for patients with high grade glioma (HGG) or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) or medulloblastoma or another rare brain cancer that expresses GD2. Because there is no standard treatment at this time, patients are being asked to volunteer in a gene transfer research study using special immune cells called T cells. T cells are a type of white blood cell that help the body fight infection.\n\nThe body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and T cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat cancer patients. They have shown promise but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.\n\nWe have found from previous research that we can put a new antibody gene into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. GD2 is a protein found on several different cancers. When we and other researchers tested DIPG/HGG cancer cells we found that many of these cancers also have GD2 on their surface.\n\nIn a study for neuroblastoma in children, we made a gene called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) from an antibody that recognizes GD2. We put this gene into the patients' own T cells and gave them back to 11 patients. We saw that the cells did grow for a while but started to disappear from the blood after 2 weeks. We think that if T cells are able to last longer they may have a better chance of killing tumor cells.\n\nIn this study, we will add a new gene to the GD2 T cells that can cause the cells to live longer. We know that T cells need substances called cytokines to survive. We have added the gene C7R that gives the cells a constant supply of cytokine and helps them to survive for a longer period of time.\n\nIn other studies using T cells some researchers found that giving chemotherapy before the T cell infusion can improve the amount of time the T cells stay in the body and therefore the effect the T cells can have. This is called lymphodepletion and we think that it will allow the T cells to expand and stay longer in the body and potentially kill cancer cells more effectively.\n\nThe GD2.C7R T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of GD2-C7R T cells, and also to evaluate how long they can be detected in the blood and what affect they have on brain cancer."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "To prepare the brain cancer specific T cells (GD2-C7R T cells), research staff will take some blood from the patient. We will grow the GD2.C7R T cells by infecting the T cells with a retroviral vector (a special virus that can carry a new gene into cells) containing one gene that can recognize and kill brain cancer cells (GD2.CAR) and the new gene called C7R that will help these cells survive longer. After the new genes have been put into the T cells, the cells will be tested to make sure that they kill GD2-positive brain cancer cells.\n\nAll patients on this study are required to have an Ommaya catheter in place prior to treatment as a precaution. This is a special catheter that leads to the tumor, the cavity left in the brain after surgical removal of the tumor, or into the fluid-filled space in the brain. If a patient does not have such a catheter already, one will need to be placed to allow for his/her treatment on this study. Catheter placement is done by a surgeon\n\nBecause we are growing the cells in the laboratory, we will also need to take blood to test for infectious viruses such as hepatitis and HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), and we will also ask patients to complete a questionnaire that is given to blood donors.\n\nThe cells generated will be frozen and stored to give back to the patient. Because patients will have received cells with a new gene in them patients will be followed for a total of 15 years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene transfer.\n\nPatients will be assigned a dose of GD2-C7R T cells. There is one dose where patients will only receive GD2 T cells without the C7R. The assigned dose of cells is adjusted based on body weight and height.\n\nIn this study, patients will receive the GD2-(C7R) cells and also receive cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. These two drugs are standard chemotherapy medicines and may be given before the T cells to make space in the blood for the T cells to grow after receiving them.\n\nCyclophosphamide and fludarabine will be given intravenously (through an i.v. needle inserted in a vein or your central line) for 2 days and then fludarabine alone on the third day.\n\nThe patient will be given an injection of GD2-(C7R) T cells into the vein through an IV line at the assigned dose. Before receiving the T cell infusion, the patient may be given a dose of Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and Tylenol (acetaminophen). The infusion will take between 1 and 10 minutes. We will then monitor the patient in the hospital for at least 5 days. The treatment will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital. The patient will need to stay in Houston for up to 4 weeks after the infusion so we can monitor for side effects.\n\nThe patient will have follow-up visits at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8, then at months 3, 6, 9, and 12, and then twice a year for the next 4 years and annually for the next 10 years for a total of 15 years. The patient will also have scheduled disease evaluations after the T-cell injection at week 6 and then as clinically needed.\n\nAfter disease re-evaluation, the patient may be eligible to receive one additional dose of T cells if the following criteria are met: (1) The disease has not gotten worse and/or it seems the patient may benefit in the future from an additional dose. (2) The patient has not had a severe side effect caused by the infusion of GD2-C7R T cells. The dose will be at the same dose level as the first infusion and separated by at least 3 months such that we can make sure there are no severe side effects between infusions. If the patient receives an additional dose of GD2-(C7R) T-cells, then they will need to stay in Houston for up to 4 weeks after the infusion as well so we can monitor for side effects.\n\nMedical tests before treatment--\n\nBefore being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests:\n\nPhysical exam\nBlood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function\nMeasurements of the tumor by routine MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)\n\nMedical tests during and after treatment--\n\nThe patient will receive standard medical tests when they are getting the infusions and afterwards:\n\nPhysical exams\nBlood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function\nMeasurements of the tumor by MRI imaging studies and spinal fluid analysis 6 weeks after the infusion and repeat MRI imaging at 3 months.\n\nSpinal Fluid Tests (optional): Spinal fluid may be drawn from the patient's existing Ommaya reservoir at week 2 and between week 6 and week 8 and possibly other timepoints if helpful for clinical care. This procedure can be done at the bedside under local anesthesia and 1-2 ml of spinal fluid (less than half a teaspoon) will be removed. Additional spinal fluid may be removed if the pressure inside the brain is elevated.\n\nTo learn more about the way the GD2-(C7R) T cells are working and how long they last in the body, an extra amount of blood will be obtained on the day that chemotherapy starts, the day of the T-cell infusion(s) and at the end of the T-cell infusion(s), 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after the T-cell infusion(s) and every 3 months for the 1st year, every 6 months for the next 4 years and annually for the next 10 years. The amount of blood taken will be based on weight with up to a maximum of 60 mL (12 teaspoons) of blood to be obtained at any one time. For children, the total amount of blood drawn will not be more than 3 mL (less than 1 teaspoon) per 1 kg of body weight on any one day. This volume is considered safe, but may be decreased if the patient is anemic (has a low red blood cell count).\n\nDuring the time points listed above, if the GD2-(C7R) T cells are found in the patient's blood at a certain amount, an extra 5 mL (about 1 teaspoon) of blood may need to be collected for additional testing.\n\nIf the patient has a procedure where tumor samples are obtained, like a blood is collected or tumor biopsy, we will request a sample to be used for research purposes.\n\nThe patient will receive supportive care for any acute or chronic toxicities, including blood components or antibiotics, and other intervention as appropriate."

          "The growing population of adolescents with insulin resistance (IR) is predicted to create a large public health burden in the next few decades. This study examines the function of brain blood vessels and cognitive function, to test if increasing severity of IR in adolescents is related to reduced cognitive function and reduced brain blood vessel function. Findings from this study may help create treatments to delay or prevent some of the negative effects of IR on cognitive and vascular health."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "One in five American adolescents is obese. Up to half of those are already exhibiting insulin resistance (IR), a hallmark of metabolic syndrome and diabetes linked to serious life-altering health disorders, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. In adults, IR negatively affects brain structure and function and is reflected in lower regional brain volumes, perfusion, increased white matter hyperintensities and abnormal neuropsychological status, especially affecting memory and attention-all changes associated with accelerated cognitive and brain aging and increased risk of dementia. In an analogous fashion, a limited set of literature suggests adolescents with IR exhibit similar brain changes during maturation. The investigators hypothesize that the brains of obese adolescents are more susceptible to insults of IR during rapid brain development, positioning them on an abnormal cognitive trajectory, and predisposing them to issues related to learning, behavioral stress responses, and depression.\n\nWhile the metabolic consequences of IR are well described in adolescence, the impact of IR on their neurocognitive status (intelligence, memory, attention, executive function, processing speed) and cerebrovascular function and their interactions remains largely unexplored. This is important since in addition to its classic role as a metabolic hormone, insulin acts as a vasodilator and supports neurotrophic signaling in healthy humans. Therefore, dysfunctional insulin signaling may hold tremendous influence over brain health in adolescents during this vital period of brain development. New insight is required to understand where, when, and how IR negatively transforms brain health, including whether a dose-response exists between IR severity and anomalies in brain and cognition.\n\nThe long-term goal of this research program is to determine the influence of IR on brain development in adolescents through the relationships between neurocognition and cerebral blood supply. The primary goal of the current project is to quantify fundamental neurocognitive and cerebrovascular function in relation to the severity of IR. The central hypothesis is that as IR worsens: a) subtle but meaningful neurocognitive declines emerge; b) regional brain perfusion is reduced primarily in areas linked to learning and memory despite preserved resting global cerebral blood flow (CBF); c) acute insulin surges exacerbate regional hypoperfusion, and d) cognitive scores will be lower, mediated in part by insulin-stimulated hypoperfusion.\n\nParticipants will be recruited primarily from pediatric and pediatric endocrinology clinics via our collaborator, Dr. Aaron Carrel, and his staff in UWHC Pediatric Endocrinology. Additionally, participants will be recruited from the greater Madison, WI community."

Pharmacists are licensed to vaccinate against the HPV virus. However, they are less likely to administer the vaccine. Although past research has recommended incorporating pharmacists to increase adolescent vaccination, no intervention studies, to our knowledge, have tested a healthcare delivery model that incorporates pharmacists to complete the HPV vaccine series. The aims of this pilot randomized controlled trial are to 1) determine the preliminary efficacy of an intervention to increase HPV vaccine series completion with the community pharmacist vs. with the primary care provider among racially/ethnically diverse participants; and 2) assess perceived intervention feasibility and acceptability of the intervention among intervention participants and primary care clinic staff."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection, and persistent infection with oncogenic HPV strains causes cancer. Commercially available 9-valent HPV vaccines offer the potential of immunity against seven oncogenic strains and the two low-risk strains that cause over 90% of genital warts. The majority of HPV-related cancers and genital warts can be prevented through the timely uptake and completion of the HPV vaccine series. However, in 2016 only 37.5% of boys and 49.5% of girls completed the HPV vaccine series, and racial/ethnic minority youth populations are least likely to complete the vaccine series. More specifically, Latino and African American populations have a higher rate of initiation of the vaccine; however, they have a significantly less likelihood of completing the vaccine series. Past research with Latino and African American populations determined the following patient-level barriers to vaccine completion: caregivers' lack of awareness to receive additional vaccine doses, lack of time to attend an additional vaccine-only primary care clinic appointment, and other structural barriers that prohibit caregivers and their children from returning to primary care clinics for additional vaccine doses. Pharmacists are licensed to vaccinate against the HPV virus. However, they are less likely to administer the vaccine. Although past research has recommended incorporating pharmacists to increase adolescent vaccination, no intervention studies, to our knowledge, have tested a healthcare delivery model that incorporates pharmacists to complete the HPV vaccine series. We propose a randomized controlled pilot study titled Community Pharmacists Vaccinate Against Cancer (CPVAC). In CPVAC, the PI will oversample for ethnic minority (particularly African American and Hispanic) HPV vaccine age-eligible children and their caregivers to take part in the study. Patients will be randomized to intervention or control group. After enrolling in the study, primary care providers of patients in the Intervention Group will contact the patients' community pharmacy and prescribe the remaining HPV vaccine dose(s). The pharmacy will electronically update patients' files and schedule the HPV vaccine \"refill\" (additional doses) at the appropriate dosing schedule. The pharmacy will contact patients' caregivers when it is time to complete additional HPV vaccine dose(s). Control group participants will receive usual care, returning to their PCPs to complete the additional HPV vaccine doses. The aims of this study are to 1) determine the preliminary efficacy of CPVAC to increase HPV vaccine series completion with the community pharmacist vs. with the primary care provider among racially/ethnically diverse participants; and 2) assess perceived intervention feasibility and acceptability of CPVAC among intervention participants and primary care clinic staff. Findings from this pilot study can be used to inform a larger randomized controlled trial to examine intervention effectiveness and analyze the cost-benefit of working with community pharmacies to enhance HPV vaccine completion among diverse children."

          "Initiated in the 1990s, perioperative Enhanced Recovery Protocols (ERPs) have progressively gained traction in a wide range of adult surgical disciplines and have decreased hospital length of stay (LOS), in-hospital costs, complications, and result in a markedly improved patient care experience that mitigates the physiologic stress of surgery and hastens recovery. Implementation of ERPs in pediatric surgery is lagging and concerted efforts to demonstrate both clinical effectiveness and to examine obstacles to implementation are needed. Specifically, pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) undergoing elective abdominal surgery represent an ideal population in which to study the implementation of ERPs. Almost one third of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and a quarter of patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) present before age 20. Up to three-quarters of CD patients require GI surgery for medically refractory disease and all patients with UC require colectomy to either manage severe disease or to mitigate cancer risks. Over the past four years, investigators modified existing adult ERPs to meet the needs of pediatric patients undergoing elective GI surgery. Based on the positive results of a pilot study, the investigators propose to conduct a multicenter, prospective, pragmatic, study using a stepped-wedge, cluster, randomized controlled trial design to evaluate the effectiveness of ERPs while assessing implementation fidelity, sustainability, and site-specific adaptations. The cluster randomized trial design is ideally suited for this type of pragmatic intervention implementation. The National Implementation Research Network's five Active Implementation Frameworks (AIFs), which identifies competency, organization, and leadership as drivers of implementation, empowers team collaboration, and facilitates rapid-cycle evaluation, will be used to optimize implementation. The investigators propose to conduct the ENhancing Recovery In CHildren Undergoing Surgery (ENRICH-US) Study in 18 US hospitals participating in the Pediatric Surgical Research Collaborative (PedSRC) by implementing and evaluating the effectiveness of the Pediatric ERP in GI Surgery on clinical outcomes for pediatric IBD patients and by measuring by fidelity and sustainability of the intervention while identifying organizational, leadership, and competency-based drivers of improved ERP implementation and sustainability."

          "This application proposes to implement an ERP for pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and undergoing elective abdominal surgery. They represent an ideal population in which to study the implementation of ERPs because almost one third of patients with CD present before age 20 and up to three-quarters of CD patients require gastrointestinal (GI) surgery for medically refractory disease. A quarter of UC patients present before age 20 and all patients with UC require colectomy to either manage severe disease or mitigate cancer risks. The GI surgical procedures performed in children with IBD are similar to the adult procedures for which ERPs have been well tested and validated.\n\nThe study team has previously modified existing adult ERPs to meet the needs of pediatric patients undergoing elective GI surgery, primarily for IBD, by conducting (a) a systematic literature review, (b) a national survey to assess readiness for implementation, and (c) an expert panel adjudication of ERP elements. The investigators also conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility, safety, and preliminary effectiveness of the pediatric ERP in 79 pediatric patients who underwent elective GI surgery. Patient and provider education materials were created, a learning collaborative explored drivers and obstacles to implementation, patient advocates were engaged to enhance the quality improvement process, and data were routinely fed back to the implementation team members. The pilot study demonstrated a 50% decrease in LOS, from 5 to 3 days, near elimination of intraoperative and post-operative opioid use, and a 30% decrease in perioperative fluid administration, without any increase in post-surgical complications or re-hospitalization.\n\nBased on these promising results, the investigators propose the ENhancing Recovery In CHildren Undergoing Surgery (ENRICH-US) Study in 18 US hospitals that participate in the Pediatric Surgical Research Collaborative (PedSRC). This multicenter study will use a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized, pragmatic clinical trial design to evaluate the effectiveness of ENRICH-US while also assessing implementation fidelity, sustainability, and site-specific adaptations.

          "Pediatric weight management efficacy is impacted by failure to complete treatment protocols and, for those that do complete treatment, a return to unhealthy behaviors. This project tests whether treating pain, a common comorbid condition to pediatric obesity, will enhance treatment. This study will generate results that can be translated into immediate improvements in care for families seeking treatment for pediatric obesity."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Childhood obesity is a major public health crisis in the United States, affecting 16.9% of youth aged 2-19 and 20.5% of youth aged 12-19. While current family-based interventions are effective in reducing body mass index (BMI) in adolescents; the majority of adolescents regain their excess weight within 2 years. In addition, there is a high rate of drop out from weight management programs, with 27% to 73% of families not completing the full treatment protocol. One possible mechanism influencing pediatric weight management outcomes is chronic pain. Although chronic pain affects 25 to 46% of all youth, among youth with obesity, the prevalence is upwards of 70%. The causal relationship between pain and obesity is not well understood. In some cases, chronic pain may be a precipitant that causes youth to develop obesity by limiting their activities or altering their eating habits. A more common scenario is that obesity places mechanical stresses on the body that can cause pain. With time, pain may become \"centralized.\" Either mechanism may impact youth's participation in a weight management program. However, interventions that address the relationship between chronic pain and obesity in youth are needed, yet no such interventions exist. We expect that co-treating these conditions -obesity and pain- rather than treating just the obesity, will lead to improved pediatric weight management outcomes. The proposed study will take place at the Pediatric Obesity Center at Connecticut Children's Medical Center (CCMC), as an adjunct to our Fit5 program. Fit5 is CCMC's family-based, group weight management treatment program for youth between the ages of 10-18. Consisting of 13 sessions, this multidisciplinary program focuses on behavior changes, nutrition education and physical activity within a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) framework. A brief 4 session adjunctive CBT intervention, Pain and Weight treatment (PAW), will be trialed in a group of youth entering weight management treatment and endorsing musculoskeletal pain. This will be done in three phases. First a focus group will be held to review the PAW curriculum which has already been created for this study. In phase two, a small randomized (n = 25 per condition) controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to pilot PAW. Finally, exit interviews to obtain preliminary feasibility, acceptability and retention data on PAW as compared to an information only control condition will be conducted. There is much work that continues to be needed to improve treatment for youth with obesity. The findings of this study will advance a line of research much needed to better understand outcomes and treatment for adolescents with obesity by shifting from focusing on obesity as an independent condition, and instead, treating it in the context of its comorbid conditions that may be important determinants of engagement, adherence, and outcomes. This proposal will focus on pain and obesity as a model with the intention that this could expand to other comorbidities such as sleep disturbances. The pilot data obtained through this R21 grant proposal will be used to modify the intervention and to seek R01 funding to support a large scale RCT of PAW."

The purpose of this project is to test the safety, comfort, and practicality of a new therapy that stimulates the spinal cord to facilitate activation of arm and hand muscles while practicing grasping, pinching, and reaching movements. The long-term goal is to provide better therapies that will improve the ability of children with SCI to more successfully play and accomplish everyday tasks using their arms and hands, similar to before their injury."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Adults with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) rank gaining arm and hand function as the highest priority for improving their quality of life. Children with SCI, similarly experience paralysis of hand and arm muscles that limits their engagement in play and exploration typical for child development . Furthermore, pediatric-onset SCI disrupts the acquisition of motor skills involved in activities of daily living such as feeding, dressing and grooming increasing the child's dependence on a parent/caregiver. Current interventions teach persons with SCI to use a brace or splint to compensate for paralysis or weakness of hand muscles. Others are invasive requiring nerve or tendon transplantation and/or electrode implantation for functional electrical stimulation. Transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation (TcStim) is a non-invasive painless technique that augments the intrinsic capacity of the spinal cord below the level of injury to generate patterned motor output. In adults with chronic SCI, TcStim acutely (immediately) augments trunk control and improves upper extremity function when combined with task-specific training. In children with cerebral palsy, TcStim in combination with locomotor training improves walking ability. Thus, the long-term objectives are 1) to investigate the therapeutic potential of TcStim for improving arm/hand function and 2) provide high quality scientific evidence to guide the clinical use of neurotherapeutic interventions promoting recovery in children with SCI. As children with SCI represent a vulnerable population, we first must establish the safety and feasibility of any potential novel therapeutic approach. Therefore, the specific aims of this proposal are to 1) determine proof-of-principle, safety and feasibility of TcStim for acute increase of hand/arm function in children with SCI and 2) determine the safety and feasibility of TcStim in combination with activity-based upper extremity training (AB-UET) across 40 sessions in children with SCI. For this pilot study 8-10 participants, ages 5-18 years with chronic, acquired SCI who have completed ≥ 40 sessions of activity-based upper extremity training (AB-UET) with neuromuscular stimulation will be recruited. For Aim 1, TcStim parameters will be optimized for arm/hand function. Arm/hand function will be assessed using the three tasks: overhead reach, forward reach and grasp and in-hand manipulation for no-TcStim and TcStim conditions measuring kinematics, electromyography of arm and hand muscles. For Aim 2 (safety and feasibility), two participants will undergo 40 sessions of AB-UET in combination with TcStim. To assess long-term safety and feasibility, participant compliance and any difficulties (i.e. risks, discomfort) will be documented and risk-likelihood/risk-benefit established. The long-term goal is to provide better therapies that will improve the ability of children with SCI to use their arms and hands with more success to grasp, reach and use their hands for everyday play and daily tasks."

The proposed Phase II project aims to develop and test the efficacy of a mobile app, called Rewire, that is geared toward helping high risk adolescent substance users reduce or quit their substance use. The Rewire app is based on the primary substance use cessation components tested in our previous work with juvenile justice-involved adolescents and on intervention components shown to be central to smoking cessation; it applies a mindfulness approach as the guiding framework for the intervention."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "There is growing evidence that interventions based on mindfulness have been an efficacious intervention for a variety of problems, including substance use among adolescents. We propose to adapt and test the feasibility and efficacy of a smart phone application (app) intervention prototype that would help adolescent substance users reduce or quit their substance use through the development of stress reduction, emotion regulation, and mindfulness skills. During the development process, 20 high-risk adolescents will be recruited for participation in focus groups and usability testing of early versions of the app; their initial reactions to content and functionality will help guide final iterations. Rewire is a twelve module program, and each module consists of a teaching component and a practice component. Modules take 5 minutes or less to complete. Module topics include developing an awareness of mind and body states, mindful decision making, and maintaining sobriety.\n\nIn this study, the Rewire app will be evaluated with 400 high risk adolescents that are involved in the juvenile justice system; the first 20 adolescents will be involved in the development process and the remaining 380 participants will be randomly and equally assigned to the Rewire condition (n = 190) or the Department of Youth Services standard treatment condition (n = 190). Youth will be assessed at baseline and will be instructed to attempt to reduce substance use with a target quit date of 28 days in the future. The Rewire group will receive instructions for using the app in the 28 days following baseline. All youth will complete 1 and 3 month followups. Assessments will consist of online surveys asking about substance use, emotion regulation, family demographics, and mindfulness practices. The Rewire group will also be asked for their thoughts and opinions on the app. Biochemical verification of self-reported substance use, a urine sample, will be collected at each interview."

          "A common procedure in children with cancer is the spinal tap, or lumbar puncture (LP), in which a needle is inserted into the spinal canal. In this population, LPs are most commonly performed to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, the liquid surrounding the brain and spinal cord) for diagnostic testing, and to inject medications including chemotherapy. Local analgesic (pain control medicine) during pediatric LP procedures is underutilized and not standardized. The first local analgesic routinely used for LP procedures was lidocaine injection. The discovery of the topical EMLA (lidocaine 2.5%/prilocaine 2.5%) cream, approved by the FDA for local skin use in pediatric patients, has provided an additional option for local LP analgesia. A comparison between topical EMLA vs lidocaine injection for LP pain control in the pediatric population has not been performed. Pediatric oncology patients often require serial LPs for diagnostics purposes and/or chemotherapy delivery. Due to a lack of standardization of LP analgesia in this population, the investigators have designed a prospective, single-blind, randomized control crossover trial to examine EMLA vs. lidocaine injection in reducing pain associated with LP in children being treated for leukemia or lymphoma."

Per standard of care for participants with obesity, the participants have a scheduled follow up for a weight check at regular intervals that can include one month, 3 months or 6 months.\n\nThe 40 participants will be randomly assigned to either a control group or an intervention group.\n\nSurvey:\n\nA 23 item PedsQL 4.0 pre-survey will be administered to pediatric participants to establish a baseline at their wellness visits. The parent of the participant will also be given a PedsQL survey to fill out. The participants' Body Mass Index (BMI) and blood pressure will be recorded. At the end of the 6-month period, the same PedsQL 4.0 will be administered again to both the participant and parent at the scheduled 6-month weight check that is standard of care.\n\nThe investigators will use a text message application created by the Loyola informatics team. This application will be able to text the participants using their cell phone number via an email service from the provider. For example, 123456789@cellservice provider.com. This allows the research team to send text messages to be sent through an application without using a personal phone number. In addition, it offers automatic responses that will save them when sending messages to the participant.\n\nFor six months, participants in the study will receive a text message twice per week via this application.\n\nText messaging:\n\nThere will be two groups within this study-a control group and an intervention group. For the control group, participants will receive two text messages weekly. The first text message will ask if the participants have completed the recommended activity. When a participant responds, the participant will receive a second text message stating, \"Thanks for your response.\"\n\nIn the intervention group, the first text message will ask if the participant completed the recommended activity. If the participant responds yes, the participant will receive a positive reinforcement response comprising the words \"Great job! We're so proud of you! Keep up the good work!\". If the participant responds no, the participant will receive a text message stating, \"Thank you for your response.\"\n\nStudy Activities:\n\nThe weekly activities the investigators will recommend for the participants include:\n\nWalking for 30 minutes 3 times a week\nSpeed walk for 30 minutes 3 times a week\nWalk up and down stairs for 30 minutes 3 times a week\nJogging for 30 minutes 3 times a week\nJumping jacks for 30 minute 3 times a week\n\nData:\n\nAll participant data will be stored in a protected Data-base, REDcap.\n\nStatistical analysis:\n\nIn this study, participants who are age 18 and under with a BMI in at least the 95th percentile will be asked to complete assigned exercises. For six months, these participants will receive a text message twice per week asking whether the participant has completed the assigned exercises. For participants marking \"Yes\", exactly one half will be randomized to receive a positive reinforcement response comprising the words \"Great job! We're so proud of you! Keep up the good work!\". The other half will receive a control response comprising the words \"Thanks for your response\"; all participants marking \"No\" will receive this same response. The study will use a 1:1 allocation.\n\nSix months following randomization, one goal of the proposed study is to test the null hypothesis that average total score on PedsQL 4.0 questionnaire between the two groups are equal. With a proposed sample size of 20 assigned to receive the positive reinforcement response and 20 assigned to receive the control response (N = 40), the study will have power of 80.0 percent to yield a statistically significant result. This computation assumes a mean difference between the two cohorts of 14.8 points (corresponding to means of 81.8 for the positive reinforcement cohort and 67.0 for the control response cohort) and a common within-group standard deviation of 16.3 points (Schwimmer, et al.). This computation also assumes the criterion for significance (alpha) is 0.05 and that the test will be 2-tailed, meaning an effect in either direction will be interpreted.\n\nRecommended Protocol Text for the Analysis Plan:\n\nParticipants under age 18 with a BMI in at least the 95th percentile will be asked to complete assigned exercises and will receive text messages asking the participants if the participant has completed such exercises. At baseline and the end of the study, the participants will complete the 23-item PedsQL 4.0 assessment. For each participant, the baseline value will be subtracted from the 6-month value. An independent samples t-test will be used to compare this delta score between the cohort assigned to receive the positive reinforcement response and the cohort assigned to receive the control response. For this comparison, the normal distribution assumption of the delta score will be assessed using QQ plots and outliers will be assessed using box plots. The homogeneity of variances assumption will be assessed using Levene's test. If any parametric assumption is strongly violated, a non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test may be used to compare ranked PedsQL 4.0 scores between the two cohorts. All analyses will be completed using SAS version 9.4 (Cary, NC) by a Biostatistician in the Clinical Research Office.\n\nSafety Monitoring Plan:\n\nThere are no adverse events that could be associated with text messages the investigators will send to the participants. The investigators will send these text messages on Monday early evening between the 5pm to 6pm. The investigators chose this time because participants will not be in school and are unlikely to be driving or doing activities that the participants could be distracted from when receiving the text, which could cause harm.\n\nIf there is an adverse effect, the investigators will ask the participants to notify the principal investigator of the project. The investigators will review safety information once a month."

          "Patients becoming infected during hospitalization occurs frequently and causes harm. It is important for healthcare facilities to take action to prevent these infections and their spread between patients. Despite the presumption of a \"sterile\" environment, one place where spread of infection is known to happen is in the operating room. This occurs as a result of frequent interaction among healthcare providers, the patient and the environment of the room. Hand washing is an important component of preventing the spread of infections. Scientific evidence has shown that making it easier for people to wash their hands can have two important impacts: (1) reduction of environmental bacterial contamination and (2) reduction in spread of bacterial pathogens. OR PathTrac is new technology that allows tracking of bacterial spread. While data exists about bacterial contamination and transmission in the adult operating room, there is very minimal data about this in the pediatric operating room. Primary aim: To use OR PathTrac to evaluate the effect of a personal hand washing device in reducing operating room exposure to bacterial pathogens in pediatric patients. We hypothesize that this hand washing system will decrease exposure to pathologic bacteria in the pediatric operating room. Secondary aim: To gain knowledge about baseline bacterial contamination and transmission in pediatric operating rooms. We will answer this question by comparing bacterial cultures taken from operating rooms whose personnel are trained to use the hand washing device to operating rooms who are not trained to use the device."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "I. Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize that the use of a personal hand hygiene system by anesthesia providers in the OR, combined with a novel infectious pathogen tracking system will decrease patient exposure to pathologic bacteria in the pediatric operating room.\n\nPrimary aim: To use a novel pathogen tracking system (OR PathTrac) to evaluate the effect of a personal hand hygiene device in reducing operating room exposure to bacterial pathogens in pediatric patients.\n\nSecondary aim: To gain knowledge about the baseline bacterial contamination and transmission patterns in pediatric operating rooms.\n\nII. Background and Significance:\n\nHealthcare-associated infections (HAIs) occur frequently and are associated with patient harm. These infections are becoming more difficult to treat due to antibiotic resistance. It is important that healthcare facilities take the necessary steps to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria between patients. ESKAPE bacteria (Enterococcus, S. aureus , Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacter spp.) are particularly problematic because they have a unique capacity to acquire resistance traits.8 Isolation of these organisms from intraoperative reservoirs has been associated with postoperative infection development.\n\nMany provider-environment-patient interactions occur during routine care in the operating room and must be considered in the development of a successful infection control program. Peaks in environmental contamination that exceed 100 CFU, a threshold associated with high-risk bacterial transmission events repeatedly associated with increased patient mortality and infection, 15 occur during induction and emergence of anesthesia. In turn, these high task density periods correlate with nadirs in hand hygiene (HH) compliance (1.8% HH compliance during induction with 147 environmental CFU and 2.3% HH compliance during emergence with 103 environmental CFU). This work led us to hypothesize that an important consideration for improved OR HH was proximity to the provider.\n\nAn intraoperative HH improvement strategy leveraged proximity to the provider and increased provider HH rates 27-fold as compared to those achieved with conventional wall-mounted devices (P < 0.002; 95% confidence interval, 3.3-13.4). Increased HH reduced environmental contamination below 100 CFU (78 fewer colonies per surface sampled; P =0.01). In turn, high risk bacterial transmission events were decreased (32.8% control vs. 7.5% treatment, OR, 0.17; P <0.01), and postoperative HAIs [3.8% treatment vs. 17.2% control, OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.00-0.81, P=0.02, NNT 5.7, including bloodstream, respiratory, urinary tract, and surgical site infections] were reduced.\n\nMuch of the aforementioned data has been established in adult operating room patients, there is very little knowledge about this as it pertains to the pediatric operating room. The investigators plan to use a similar evidence-based, hand hygiene improvement strategy to reduce intraoperative transmission of ESKAPE pathogens in the pediatric operating room. After watching a 20-minute instructional video discussing the importance adhering to the many hand hygiene opportunities in the operating room, anesthesia providers will be given a personal hand hygiene device with actionable real-time performance feedback containing 64% ethyl alcohol. The personalized device will be affixed to the provider's waist and will remain there for use throughout the entire case. The number of personal hand hygiene events and a personal hourly hand hygiene rate is visible to the individual providing performance feedback in real time. Devices will be handed out for the case and retrieved on case completion.\n\nThe investigators will utilize OR PathTrac, a systematic reservoir collection and software analysis platform, to examine the impact of the device on ESKAPE pathogens. The OR PathTrac system will provide the platform for acquisition of ESKAPE isolates from key reservoirs in the operating room. Systematic phenotypic analysis guided by OR PathTrac will identify epidemiologically related isolates. Related isolates are defined by previously reported thresholds, 12 aligned by temporal association (the reservoir order of collection over time), and mapped to identify bacterial source(s) of transmission. Source identification provides a feedback loop that can be used for proactive optimization of infection control measures. For example, anesthesia resident physician hands are proven to be a typical source of transmission for desiccation tolerant S. aureus isolates that are linked to infection. In the future, this evidence can then be used to proactively optimize the hand hygiene improvement strategy through individual and group level feedback. The OR PathTrac software platform can subsequently measure and report the effectiveness (fidelity) of the improvements, allowing for proactive optimization to achieve sustainability.\n\nIII. Research Methods\n\nA. Outcome Measure(s):\n\nPrimary outcome measure: The primary endpoint of this study will be the incidence of OR ESKAPE exposure/S. aureus ERTEs with and without the hand hygiene intervention in the pediatric OR.\n\nSecondary outcome measure: Detection and mapping of intraoperative ESKAPE exposure as it pertains to the pediatric operating room.\n\nB. Description of Population to be Enrolled:\n\nThis study will include anesthesia providers and pediatric patients, age 1-18 years old, presenting to the main operating room at Children's Hospital Colorado. All, anesthesia providers at Children's Hospital Colorado will be eligible. Patients requiring general anesthesia and placement of a peripheral intravenous catheter will be enrolled.\n\nC. Study Design and Research Methods\n\nTwo patients (case pair) undergoing general anesthesia in a randomly selected operating room will be evaluated in a serial manner in order to detect transmission of pathogenic bacteria. A total of 20 case pairs (or 40 patients) will be enrolled. Ten of the case pairs will serve as the intervention group in which the anesthesia provider will be given a personal hand hygiene device to track hand hygiene in real-time. The remaining 10 case pairs will serve as a control group for whom the anesthesia providers will proceed with care per usual practice. Patient care will not change due to their participation in this study, and they will undergo general anesthesia and surgery according to usual practice. Patients will not be asked to perform any tasks for the purpose of the study. The following information will be recorded on the day of surgery:\n\nPatients name, case log ID, medical record number. These will be maintained by the research team for approximately 30 days after surgery.\nDate of surgery, whether it is 1st case vs. 2nd case.\nPatient diagnosis, ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) physical health classification status, age, comorbidities, surgery type & duration, anesthesia provided and duration of anesthesia.\nAttending Anesthesiologist name with patient case ID log.\nWound classification\nAdmitted from (location i.e.: home, unit, etc)\n\nMicrobiology cultures will be obtained from three intraoperative reservoirs (patient, anesthesia provider, anesthesia workspace) for each case. Anesthesia induction will occur prior to obtaining patient cultures. A sterile nasal swab will be inserted gently into the internal surface of each nostril & rotated 10 times to culture. In addition, a sterile swab will be inserted gently into the axilla (armpit) and groin of each patient bilaterally & rotated 10 times to culture.\n\nCultures of the anesthesia provider's hands will be done prior to the case beginning, at the end of the case, and any time they return to the operating room. To collect samples for culture, the provider will be asked to dip their dominant hand into a bag containing sterile sampling solution for 60 seconds. All intraoperative anesthesia providers will potentially be involved. Only those providers who agree to participate will have a culture collected.\n\nThree cultures from the anesthesia workspace (2 from the anesthesia machine and one from the patient's intravenous catheter tubing) will be cultured.\n\nAPL Valve and Agent Dial Culture\n\nFor case 1-prior to anesthesia care provider entering the OR, 2 sites on the anesthesia machine (adjustable pressure limiting (APL) valve complex & agent dial) will be decontaminated & cultured aseptically. A repeat culture will be obtained at the end of the case. For Case 2, the APL valve and agent dial will not be decontaminated but will be cultured as in case 1.\n\nIV Stopcock Culture\n\nSterile intravenous stopcock sets will be provided preoperatively for each case. The internal lumens of the stopcocks will be cultured on case completion. Microbiology cultures will be obtained by the research team on the day of surgery for each case 1 & case 2. Each culture will be given a study ID & transported to the RDB Bioinformatics laboratory (RDB Bioinformatics, University of Iowa Bioventures Center, 2500 Cross Park Rd, E133, Coralville, IA 52241) at the end of the day using IATA shipping protocols for microbiology assay. No patient or anesthesia care provider information will accompany the samples, and no culture results will be conveyed to the study team. This will ensure that no culture results for a specific person will be known by any study team member. A total of 13 cultures will be obtained from each case for a total of 520 cultures for this study.\n\nD. Description, Risks and Justification of Procedures and Data Collection Tools:\n\nThis study presents no more than minimal risk to the participants.\n\nData Collection Tools:\n\nReservoir sampling: OR PathTrac (RDB Bioinformatics, Omaha, NE 68154) collection kits will be used to sample 13 proven reservoirs in each operating room observational unit that is randomly selected for analysis. Reservoirs sampled will include the adjustable pressure-limiting valve and agent dial of the anesthesia machine at case start and at case end (N=2), anesthesia attending physician and primary assigned assistant (resident physician or certified-registered nurse anesthetist) hands before case start and at case end (N=4), the patient nares (both sides), axilla (armpit, both sides), and groin (both sides) after induction and stabilization and at case end prior to emergence (N=6), and the surface of the closed, disinfectable stopcock and/or internal lumen of the open lumen (N=1).\nDemographics: OR number, date, patient age, sex, American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) physical health classification status (I-IV), anesthesia duration (hours), procedure duration (hours), total case duration (hours), comorbidities, preoperative location (same day admit, hospital floor, intensive care unit, other), preadmission yes/no, duration of preadmission (hours), discharge location (post anesthesia care unit, hospital floor, same day unit, intensive care unit, other), dirty or infected surgery yes/no, type of surgery (general abdominal, thoracic, cardiac, general breast, plastics, gynecology/oncology, vascular, etc.), prophylactic antibiotic (yes/no), type of antibiotic and dose, preoperative nasal decolonization (yes/no), type decolonization (povidone iodine, mupirocin, other), days of decolonization, preoperative chlorhexidine (yes/no), concentration and days of chlorhexidine, intraoperative mean and median temperature, postoperative glucose (or other) in mg/dL if measured, surgical provider (assign a code for de-identification), anesthesia provider(s) with de-identified code, postoperative unit location (e.g. 3120 west unit), and same day unit location (e.g. same day room 31).\nPostoperative (within 30 days) elevated white blood cell count yes/no, fever (>38.4 degrees Celsius yes/no), office documentation of infection (yes/no), anti-infective order yes/no, culture positive yes/no, type of culture (sputum, wound, blood, urine, other body fluid). This information will be obtained by chart review by the assistant before and after the procedure."

          "Since severe obesity in youth has been steadily increasing. Specialized pediatric obesity clinics provide programs to aid in reducing obesity. Since the home environment and parental behavioral modeling are two of the strongest predictors of child weight loss during behavioral weight loss interventions, a family-based treatment approach is best. This strategy has been moderately successful in our existing, evidence-based pediatric weight management program, Brenner Families In Training (Brenner FIT). However, since programs such as Brenner Families in Training rely on face-to-face interactions and delivery, they are sometimes by the time constraints experienced by families. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop and pilot a tailored, mobile health component to potentially increase the benefits seen by Brenner FIT standard program components and similar pediatric weight management programs."

All youth participants will receive a commercially available activity monitor. Caregivers will receive podcasts with a story about a caregiver supporting weight loss in a child by providing healthy foods/activities for his/her family, including healthy eating and physical activity information. Children will receive animated videos that contain healthy eating and physical activity messaging, with an engaging story of a child losing weight. All participants will have access to a website and mobile apps where they will track weight, diet, and physical activity for themselves (youth) or their child (parents). Based on their reports of weight, eating, and physical activity, the messaging received from clinical staff by the families will be individually tailored to promote healthy behaviors and overcome perceived barriers. The proposed research is innovative in that it explicitly incorporates theory into the intervention and evaluation components of the project and builds upon an existing literature on mobile health interventions that use mobile technology."

          "The majority of adolescents with obesity demonstrate declining beta cell (β-cell) function and progressive insulin resistance over their lifetime.1 In our population of lower income minority teens, 1 in 3 have obesity or severe obesity and of those 30-50% go on to develop PD or T2D during adolescence or as young adults.1 Although diet and increased adiposity play a significant role in the pathogenesis of these conditions, the standard treatment model of intensive lifestyle modifications often result in modest decrease in BMI z-score of -0.1-0.2 SD.2, 3 There is a paucity of trials that have examined the effect of time limited eating (TLE) interventions in the treatment of youth with obesity.4 Novel dietary approaches like time limited eating have been shown to be effective for weight loss and improved glycemic control in adults with obesity but have not been examined in children.5, 6 A TLE approach involves interspersing normal daily caloric intake with 16-hour periods of calorie restriction/fasting several times a week.7-9 TLE may actually be more feasible, non-stigmatizing, flexible and effective for adolescents than alternatives like severe caloric restriction because it removes the need for intensive counting of daily caloric intake or macronutrient content and focuses on a straightforward task of consuming food during a pre-specified time period.4, 10, 11 One major limitation to implementing any dietary intervention in pediatric populations is concern for poor adherence and difficulty in reliably assessing compliance. We aim to overcome these issues with the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to monitor and promote adherence to the intervention and thus improve overall efficacy. In addition, the use of CGM will provide important outcome data related to overall glycemic response. Finally, we will evaluate whether providing individual feedback based on CGM data to subjects as real time biofeedback as part of the intervention, enhances efficacy. We propose a randomized controlled trial in 60 children (age 14-18) with obesity (BMI% > 95th percentile) recruited from clinical programs at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA). Patients will be randomized to one of three treatment groups for a 12-week intervention: Group 1) Low sugar and carbohydrate diet (LSC, <90 gm carbohydrate (CHO)/day, <25 gm added sugar/day) + blinded CGM (used to monitor adherence and glycemic outcomes without real time feedback). Group 2) LSC+TLE (16-hour fast/8-hour feed for 5 days per week) + blinded CGM, Group 3) LSC+TLE+ real time feedback via CGM (to evaluate effect of providing CGM data on intervention efficacy).\n\nWe have 3 Specific Aims:\n\nAim 1. Test the efficacy of adding a TLE approach to a LSC intervention on body fat and weight loss (Group 2 vs. Group 1). Hypothesis 1: LSC+TLE will result in greater decrease in body fat and zBMI than LSC alone.\n\nAim 2. Test the efficacy of LSC+TLE compared to LSC alone on reduction on glycemic response (CGM) and psychosocial parameters (Group 2 vs. Group 1). Hypothesis 2: TLE+LSC will result in a greater improvement in glucose control (FBG) and psychosocial parameters.\n\nAim 3. Evaluate if CGM use is a feasible tool to determine dietary compliance to TLE type interventions and determine the impact of unblinded CGM on dietary intervention adherence and efficacy (Group 3 vs. Group 2). Hypothesis 3a: CGM will be a feasible tool to determine dietary compliance. Hypothesis 3b: Unblinded CGM data will result in 1) improved adherence to the dietary intervention as assessed by percent time in range when compared to those wearing a blinded CGM and 2) improve intervention effects.\n\nOverall Impact: This research will generate new knowledge that can readily be integrated into clinical weight management programs to optimize their impact and accelerate healthy changes for youth with obesity. This dietary intervention could lead to global improvement and result in slowed disease progression, decreased complications and reduced prevalence of secondary comorbidities that arise from a lifetime of obesity.\n\nVirtual Adaptation: To respond to the COVID-19 research restriction the study protocol was adapted for a 100% virtual model in which all study procedures, consent and outcome measures were collected virtually. For this cohort the aim was to recruit 10-12 completer per study arm with a maximum anticipated recruitment of 20-30 adolescents per group. For the virtual adaptation there is no DEXA scan or blood testing that is collected due to the in-person restriction."

          "In type 1 diabetes (T1DM), automated insulin delivery (AID) systems such as the hybrid closed loop artificial pancreas (HCL AP) combine the use of an insulin pump, continuous blood sugar monitor, and control algorithm to adjust background insulin delivery to improve time in target blood sugar range. Systems such as the predictive low glucose suspend system (PLGS) pause insulin delivery to try and reduce low blood sugars. We aim to complete a pilot study involving recruitment of youth ages 7 to 18 years from the following groups with type 1 diabetes: control participants consisting of youth on either multiple daily insulin injections or conventional insulin pump therapy that plan to continue with their current treatment modality, youth being transitioned to the HCL AP system, and youth being transitioned to the PLGS system. Individuals will be recruited into each of the aforementioned study groups based on their own expressed desire to either continue on MDI/standard insulin pump therapy or transition to either the HCL AP or PLGS systems. The decision to either continue with current therapy or transition therapy will remain entirely up to the participant and their family and will be based on personal preference and insurance coverage for that individual. We will not be randomizing the participants to any given treatment group during this study but rather will be recruiting based on the participant's decision. We would like to complete a physical exam with pubertal staging, collect blood and urine samples to evaluate cardiometabolic and renal markers, and complete a DXA scan to evaluate total lean and fat mass. After 3-6 months of either continuation of current treatment with either multiple daily insulin injections or conventional insulin pump therapy or transitioning to the HCL AP or PLGS systems, we would like to repeat the previously described blood, urine, and imaging tests for comparison. We are interested in examining the impact of the HCL AP and PLGS systems on maintaining blood sugars in target range, insulin sensitivity, and markers of cardiometabolic and renal function. We hypothesize that pauses in insulin delivery, as seen in the setting of automated insulin delivery systems, will result in improvements in insulin sensitivity, cardiometabolic markers, and renal function markers."

          "Background: Over 1.25 million Americans have type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), significantly increasing the risk of early death from cardio-renal disease. Per the American Diabetes Association, only 14% of children with T1DM meet glycemic targets [Wood et al. Diabetes Care 2013; 36:2035-37]. This is a severe and pervasive problem, as a child diagnosed with T1DM today is expected to live up to 17 years less than non-diabetic peers. It is established that time outside of goal glycemic target range increases the likelihood of developing micro- and macro-vascular diabetic complications including diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, metabolic risk factors beyond glycemic control including insulin resistance and obesity are also increasingly recognized to contribute to the increased risk of DKD and CVD. Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems such as the hybrid closed loop artificial pancreas (HCL AP) combine use of an insulin pump, continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and a control algorithm to adjust background insulin delivery to improve time in target range. AID systems such as the predictive low glucose suspend (PLGS) system pause insulin delivery to try to reduce hypoglycemia. AID systems are now seeing markedly increased commercial use; however, the long-term effects on insulin sensitivity, body mass index (BMI), cardio-metabolic markers, and kidney function have not yet been studied. Preliminary basic science research suggests that periods of rest from insulin exposure provided by AID systems may have positive effects on DKD and CVD risk. In this proposal we intend to investigate the gap in knowledge between glycemic changes seen with AID systems and the impact on markers of long-term complications.\n\nSpecific Aims and Hypotheses:\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To examine the effects of the AID systems on glycemic control and insulin sensitivity as compared to traditional insulin pumps and multiple daily injections in youth with T1DM Hypothesis 1.1: Treatment with the AID systems improves glycemic control in youth with T1DM Hypothesis 1.2: Treatment with the AID systems increases insulin sensitivity and decreases insulin requirement in youth with T1DM\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To examine the effects of the AID systems on kidney function and metabolic markers as compared to traditional insulin pumps and multiple daily injections in youth with T1DM Hypothesis 2.1: Treatment with the AID systems improves metabolic markers in youth with T1DM Hypothesis 2.2: Treatment with the AID systems improves kidney function in youth with T1DM\n\nDesign: This study is a pilot study aimed at recruiting youth ages 7 to 18 years from the following 3 groups with T1DM: control participants on either multiple daily injections or conventional pump therapy, youth being transitioned to a HCL AP system, and youth being transitioned to a PLGS system. Exclusion criteria include non-T1DM, non-insulin blood glucose altering medications, pregnancy, breastfeeding, or a ketogenic diet. We plan to complete a physical exam with pubertal staging, collect information on recent insulin usage and dosages, fasting serum and urine samples, and a DXA scan before the participant transitions to either a HCL AP or a PLGS system, if applicable. Following 3-6 months of treatment we will then collect the identical data as at baseline. Outcome measures include CGM data, total daily insulin dose, time suspended from insulin delivery, height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, blood pressure, HbA1c, c-peptide, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, adiponectin, and DXA scan to evaluate cardio-metabolic markers and calculate insulin sensitivity, as well as serum creatinine, cystatin c, copeptin, and urine microalbumin to evaluate kidney health and calculate GFR by Zappitelli and FAS equations."

The rationale is that once post-concussion MSK injury risk factors are known and prevention strategies tested, concussion RTP protocols will evolve to include injury risk reduction programs."

To examine the effect of a neuromuscular training (NMT) program on clinical and instrumented postural control measures before and after the intervention.\n\nThe proposed study will use an intervention-based paradigm to further understand MSK injury risk after concussion RTP and to identify potential methods to reduce this risk. Common Data Element (CDE) and instrumented postural control data will be linked to objectively classify the clinical and functional underpinnings of concussion recovery and subsequent MSK injury among those engaged in an injury prevention program compared to those who are not. These are important elements to investigate because: 1) few studies have explored the mechanisms for MSK injury incidence after concussion using a multimodal and objective approach and 2) no investigations have examined interventions to improve long-term concussion outcomes initiated at RTP."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Outcomes for children with recurrent or progressive cerebellar malignant brain tumors are very poor, and there are a lack of effective salvage therapies once a patient fails standard treatments. G207 is an oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV) that has been successfully engineered to introduce mutations in the virus that enable it to selectively replicate in and kill cancer cells, but not normal cells. Replication of G207 in the tumor not only kills the infected tumor cells, but causes the tumor cell to act as a factory to produce new virus. These virus particles are released as the tumor cell dies, and can then proceed to infect other tumor cells in the vicinity, and continue the process of tumor kill. In addition to this direct oncolytic activity, the virus engenders an anti-tumor immune response; the virus is immunogenic and produces a debris field which exposes cancer cell antigens to immune cells which can target other cancer cells. Thus, the oncolytic effect of the virus and the immune response that the virus stimulates provide a \"one-two punch\" at attacking cancer cells. In preclinical studies, a single 5 Gy dose of radiation within 24 hours of virus inoculation to the tumor increased virus replication and tumor cell killing.\n\nThe safety of G207 has been demonstrated in 3 phase I clinical trials involving adults with supratentorial high-grade gliomas adults at the University of Alabama (UAB) and in an ongoing phase I clinical trial involving children with recurrent supratentorial brain tumors at Children's of Alabama. In the adult trials, high doses (up to 3 x 10^9 plaque-forming units) of virus were safely injected directly into the tumor or surrounding brain tissue without serious toxicities. Radiographic and neuropathologic evidence of anti-tumor responses have been seen. Preclinical laboratory studies have demonstrated that a variety of aggressive pediatric brain tumor types are sensitive to G207.\n\nThis study is a phase I, open-label, single institution clinical trial of G207 alone or combined with a single low dose of radiation in children with recurrent or progressive cerebellar brain tumors.The primary goal is to determine safety. The secondary aims are to obtain preliminary information on the effectiveness of and immune response to G207. A traditional 3 + 3 design will be used with four patient cohorts. The first cohort will receive G207 alone, and the next cohorts will receive G207 at one of three doses followed by a 5 Gy dose of radiation to active areas of tumor."

          "In this study, investigators look at a different type of technology that might help to avoid having to perform CT scans in certain patients suspected of having a head injury. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) uses a specific light wavelength to determine if there is bleeding into the head as a result of trauma. Investigators will study NIRS, using a device called the Infrascanner model 2000, to determine if it is as good at detecting bleeding in the head as CT scan, which is the current gold standard. Investigators will try to determine if NIRS can rule in or rule out bleeding into the head, and perhaps this can help to avoid subjecting these youth to the potentially harmful effects of radiation. Investigators will also study how easy it is to use NIRS so that it might become a standard part of the workup for children with suspected head injury."

          "Patients that present to Dayton Children's Hospital with a head CT order for suspected TBI will be approached for enrollment. An alert will notify study personnel as CT scans are ordered. The goal is to obtain NIRS data within four-hours before or after the CT scan. Informed consent will be obtained according to institutional protocols. NIRS data will be obtained using Infrascanner model 2000 (Infrascanner Inc.). Eight data points will be collected for each subject in standard fashion from right to left frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital locations. Study personnel will be trained by the manufacturer and will be blinded to the results of the CT scan. Data stored on the Infrascanner will be subsequently transferred to a password-protected database for storage and analysis. For each participant scanned with the Infrascanner 2000, they will be de-identified with a subject number, with patient demographics, mechanism of injury, GCS presentation, time of CT scan, and time of NIRS recorded. CT scan results comprise presence of epidural hematoma and/or subdural hematoma and its maximal thickness if present; presence of intraparenchymal hematoma; presence of skull fracture; and any other traumatic injuries contained in the CT scan report. The length of time required to acquire NIRS data will also be recorded for quality improvement purposes.\n\nThe specific aims of this study are to better understand the epidemiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI) at Dayton Children's Hospital, to establish the operating characteristics of NIRS for suspected traumatic intracranial hemorrhage at Dayton Children's Hospital, and to study the implementation of a new diagnostic modality in a busy tertiary care emergency department."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Temperature management is an important aspect of perioperative care that falls under the purview of the anesthesiologist. Temperature is recognized as one of four primary vital signs and significant deviations from normal values may result in patient harm. General anesthesia disrupts the body's temperature homeostasis by inhibiting temperature regulation mechanisms such as vasoconstriction/-dilation, shivering and behavioral interventions (donning clothes or leaving an area with excessive heat, for example). Anesthetized patient have a tendency to become hypothermic, especially during long surgical procedures. This results from both the redistribution of cooler peripheral temperatures into the core (due to vasodilation) as well as actual temperature loss to a cold operating room environment (which is maintained at a lower temperature for the comfort of fully gowned surgeons and nurses). In addition, large surgical incisions predispose the patient to hypothermia through evaporation and convection.\n\nHypothermia is a recognized risk factor that predisposes the patient to an increased metabolic rate, increased oxygen demand, coagulopathies, impaired wound healing, impaired immune function and increased risk of infection. Therefore, maintenance of normal body temperature is an important goal of every general anesthetic - and is a well-accepted quality metric associated with patient care. Because of the greater surface area to volume relationship, children are thought to be a greater risk of intraoperative hypothermia.\n\nThe most widely used method of maintaining body temperature during surgery (and a routine at this institution) is by using a forced-air warming blanket (Bair Hugger warming blanket, 3M). Despite its widespread use, the forced-air warming blanket has its limitations. For example, during certain surgical procedures, the location of the surgical field precludes placement of the warming blanket. In addition, the warming blanket often cannot be placed immediately after the induction of anesthesia (when complex patient positioning is required) - leaving the patient exposed to hypothermic conditions for short (10-15min) or long (30-60min) periods of time. There is hence a need for alternative warming systems that could be implemented immediately following anesthetic induction.\n\nWestmed, Inc. has developed an alternative system that utilizes a heated, humidified breathing circuit to regulate a patient's body temperature in the intraoperative setting. This system is active from the moment the trachea is intubated following anesthetic induction, i.e. there are no delays in instituting thermal management."

        "EligibilityCriteria": [
          "INCLUSION CRITERIA:\nMales and females 24 months to <18 years at informed consent\n\nActive GH excess as demonstrated by the following:\n\nIGF-1 greater than the upper limit of normal for age and sex during screening (>+2 SD) and\nAbnormal GH levels as demonstrated by inability to suppress to <1 ng/mL within 2 hours during Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) after the administration of 1.75gr/kg (max 75gr) of glucose or elevated GH secretion profile during overnight sampling.\nHistory of inadequate response to trans-sphenoidal surgery or radiation therapy for GH secreting pituitary tumor, or inability to tolerate surgery or radiation therapies or patient deemed inappropriate candidate for surgery and/or pituitary radiation therapy, as determined by review of the medical records by the Principal Investigator. The evaluation of the patient should be performed at least 3 months after the surgery date in order to ensure that there is persistent GH excess after the transsphenoidal resection of the tumor. If the patient has received irradiation, there is no minimium time to be considered before enrolling in the study. The effects of radiation therapy take place over many years after receiving it (mean time to remission for stereotactic radiation therapy of 12-60 months), and, thus, a medical therapy is required during that period.\nWillingness to discontinue other medications for the treatment of GH excess for a 6-week washout period prior to initiating pegvisomant\nAble to provide consent/assent if developmentally appropriate\nWilling to use non-hormonal method of contraception in patients of reproductive potential. Females of reproductive age (Tanner 3 or more, and/or having menstrual cycle) will be educated on the risks of unknown potential fetal harm while using the investigational medication, and they will be educated on the alternative preventative methods for contraception (condoms). Females already receiving oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) will be evaluated by gynecology consult service to discuss effective non-hormonal contraception. Sexually active female subjects must agree to use an effective non-hormonal contraception for the duration of the study.\nHave a primary health care provider in home location who will perform regular height and weight measurements, vital signs, and safety labs.\n\nHeight and weight will be requested to be performed according to the published methods included in the CDC-NHANES manual on anthropometry procedures manual (Supplementary Material). They will be plotted on the respective growth charts produced by the CDC for the US population (Supplementary Material).\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nLiver function abnormalities (ALT, AST) greater than or equal to 3 times ULN\nPositive pregnancy test in females, current pregnancy and/or female patients who are breastfeeding.\nPatients currently using opioids. Opioids induce altered metabolism of pegvisomant. Since this is a phase 3 study, opioids may affect the PK studies to be performed and, thus, chronic use of opioids (>2 weeks) will be an exclusion criterion.\nPatients with any medical, physical, psychiatric, or social condition, which, in the opinion of the investigators, would make participation in this protocol not in their best interest, will be excluded from the study. Patients who are critically ill, unstable, or with severe organ failure that may affect/limit the endocrine evaluation and place unsustainable demands on CC or NICHD resources will be excluded."

For the baseline visit, participants will stay a few nights for testing. They may stay overnight for the other visits.\n\nAll visits will include:\n\nMedical history\n\nPhysical exam\n\nQuestionnaires\n\nHeart and liver tests\n\nParticipants may be photographed in their underwear if they agree.\n\nBlood tests: Participants will get a catheter: A small plastic tube will be placed in an arm vein. For some tests, the blood may be drawn every 30 minutes over 3 hours. For other tests, blood will be drawn every 20 minutes over 12 hours. Only clinically necessary tests will be done in each patient.\n\nAt the baseline visit, participants will have the study drug injected under the skin. They will learn to take the injection at home. They will take the injection daily during the study.\n\nThe baseline and 12-month visits will include:\n\nMRI: Participants will have a dye injected into a vein. They will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body.\n\nHand X-ray\n\nParticipants must get their height and weight at their local doctor s office monthly.\n\nParticipants must have blood and urine tests at their local lab monthly for the first 6 months then every 3 months until the study ends.\n\n..."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Growth hormone excess is a rare and potentially lethal condition associated with hypersecretion of growth hormone (GH), usually by a pituitary tumor or hyperplasia. When it occurs prior to the complete fusion of growth plates, it leads to pathological tall stature, and it is called gigantism. After the fusion of the growth plates, it is called acromegaly. It may be associated with debilitating cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes. Children and adolescents with gigantism are currently treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and medications, such as octreotide, to reduce hypersecretion of GH; however, these treatments may lack efficacy and have significant side effects. Pegvisomant is a genetically engineered GH-receptor (GHR antagonist that blocks the action of GH. In adults with acromegaly, pegvisomant has been shown to effectively reduce serum insulin-likegrowth factor type 1 (IGF-1) concentrations and lead to clinical improvement. However, experience in children and adolescents is limited to a small number of case series. We propose the initiation of a new protocol at the NICHD, NIH, to treat children and adolescents with GH excess that is refractory to surgical therapy and/or radiation therapy, or in children and adolescents where the above therapies are contraindicated."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "In this study, we will enroll female pediatric emergency department (ED) patients presenting with a diagnosis of abdominal pain who may have a transabdominal pelvic ultrasound ordered by their treating physician (or nurse practitioner). In order to maximize the visualization of organs deep within the pelvis such as the ovaries and uterus, the patient's bladder must be full. The current practice at our institution, as well as numerous others, is to have a bladder catheter placed immediately when a transabdominal pelvic ultrasound is ordered, and then to fill the bladder in a retrograde manner in order to provide enhanced visualization of the pelvic structures. The process of inserting a bladder catheter into a pediatric patient is an invasive procedure which can be traumatic and painful to the patient. Additionally, if the patient's bladder is already full, this procedure may be unnecessary.\n\nIn this study, a point-of-care bladder ultrasound will be performed, upon enrollment of a patient by a study bedside sonographer (our pediatric emergency department nurse practitioners), to assess degree of bladder fullness. This measurement will then be repeated serially while the patient is receiving hydration and the ultrasound will be performed when the bladder is full. We hypothesize that this work flow will result in an equivalent time to transabdominal pelvic ultrasound completion and will reduce the number of potentially traumatic and painful, invasive urethral bladder catheterizations."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "The complete project will incorporate three phases. Phase I is designed to gather information from existing licensed health professionals in the community who serve Medicaid populations on their knowledge needs and priorities related to screening and intervening with patients with eating disorders. Phase I will comprise eating disorder psycho-education, implementation of workshops, and supervision among primary care professionals and mental health workers. Responses will inform the content of in-services and program development (e.g., monthly consultation services, ongoing multi-family support groups) provided in Phase II.\n\nDuring Phase II, families containing a child with a restrictive-type eating disorder will be recruited to receive treatment from the clinicians assessed and trained during Phase I. Families will be assigned to receive either Family Based Treatment (FBT) or Enhanced Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT-E) to treat their adolescent's eating disorder. Treatment will occur over 10-16 weeks, depending on the family's needs and availability. Families will be assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 1-year follow-up.\n\nPhase III will consist of follow-up with the families and clinicians, and further development of training/education approaches for the Rhode Island healthcare workforce."

The dose administered will be ~20 mg/kg/day or the infant's usual daily dose. In Arm 2, n=30 children who range in age from 2 to 18 years will be administered HU, both a sprinkle formulation and capsules (Droxia® 200 mg), on two separate occasions separated by at least 1 day but no more than 30 days in a randomized, crossover fashion. The doses of HU on each occasion will be rounded to the nearest 200 mg and will not exceed 35 mg/kg or 2000 mg. We hypothesize that the PK profile of the sprinkle formulation will not differ significantly from the PK profile of Droxia® capsules in children and adolescents ages ≥2 - 18 years of age.

          "Most children diagnosed with craniosynostosis undergo a relatively extensive cranial vault remodeling procedure. The decision of performing surgical cranial shape correction for patients with craniosynostosis typically rests on a subjective visual assessment of the severity of the cranial malformation and the main goal of this procedure is to reduce the risk of elevated intracranial pressure and to provide a more normal cranial shape and volume. Personalized surgical planning systems to optimize intervention and leverage surgical expertise in the reconstruction of the cranial vault do not exist. Thus, the expertise of the surgeon is paramount for the success of the surgical correction of craniosynostosis. The goal of our project is to evaluate the feasibility and utility of a surgical plan derived from software developed at Children's National, iCSPlan."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Presurgical planning will be performed in patients that require an open crania-vault reconstruction for craniosynostosis. The participants will come from the outpatient clinics of neurosurgery and plastic surgery. The treating physician/study team member will explain and give a copy of Institutional review board (IRB) approved study information letter to the participant's legally authorized representative (LAR).\n\nThe investigators will acquire a pre-operative CT-scan, per standard of care, to help assess the synostosis severity, within 4 weeks before the procedure. A week before the surgery, a routine preoperative visit will be done where the participant and/or LAR, if agree to participate in the study, will sign the informed consent document(s).\n\nA presurgical plan will be built and will be recorded in a software, iCSPlan. Although this plan will not be integrated in the OR workflow, if needed, it would be visualized on a desktop monitor, which will be available to the surgical team. This tool will not influence any clinical decision making in the study. Instead, it will work as a rely-on tool in the preparation of the surgery, which may or may not be followed by the surgeon.\n\nDemographic information (sex, age), as well as intraoperative information (Anesthesia length, anesthesia medications, length of surgery, blood loss, # of blood units transfused, complications), will be recorded for analysis. These variables are generally recorded during surgery and add no additional operative time.\n\nFollowing the surgery, the specialists will evaluate the feasibility of the use of the presurgical plan by completing a questionnaire to report their options on (1): Quality of the surgical outcome; (2) the quality of the surgical strategy, and (3) the utility of the surgical planning in the treatment. The questions will be answered on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from \"not useful/strongly dislike\" to \"very useful/strongly like\".\n\nAll study team pre-screening materials that contain participants information will be maintained on password protected computers. Only authorized study team members will have access to the pre-screening materials. Any pre-screening protected health information (PHI) that is collected will be destroyed once study enrollment is completed."

        "BriefSummary": [
          "There are currently 28 million child refugees worldwide - approximately 1 in every 200 children on earth. To date, nearly one million forcibly displaced child migrants have been resettled in the United States. It is well documented that refugee and immigrant youth, especially forcibly displaced ethnic and cultural minority youth, present with alarmingly high rates of stress-related psychiatric illness (e.g., PTSD, depression, anxiety) and are grossly underserved by current mental health, medical, and social services. Previous research found that in a sample of 144 Somali refugee children resettled in the United States, only 8% of those who met full clinical criteria for PTSD received any mental health services. Through a process of community-based participatory research with refugee and immigrant communities and stake-holders the investigators have developed a multi-tiered psychological and systems intervention for refugee youth and families, Trauma Systems Therapy for Refugees (TST-R), that includes community outreach and advocacy, group psychological treatment, office-based psychotherapy, and home-based services.\n\nWhereas TST-R is one of the only empirically-based behavioral health treatment models for refugee youth, it has only been studied as a full intervention model; financial and staffing resource barriers have limited the wide-spread adoption of the model. This obstacle noted, implementing one high-impact component of this multi-tier intervention (i.e., protocol-driven group treatments) may provide significant benefit while also being easily scalable. Implementing time-limited (i.e., 10 week) manual-based group psychological interventions focused on culturally-responsive strategies to support refugee youth with, and at-risk for, PTSD, depression, and anxiety, may be an efficient and cost effective means of (1) reducing psychiatric symptoms for refugee and migrant youth with present symptoms, (2) preventing symptom onset for those at risk, and (3) enhancing cultural identity self-concept, subjective social belongingness, and psychological resilience (e.g., ability to thrive in the context of adversity). Furthermore, if effective, treatment groups can importantly function as a destigmatizing treatment gateway and triage to other services for youth who require a higher level of care (e.g., individual psychotherapy and medication management)."

          "This project is studying adolescents between the ages of 12 to 18 years that come to the emergency department and are in pain. We want to find out how well art therapy is able to decrease the pain they are experiencing. Art therapy will involve making art and working with an art therapist to find new ways of expressing thoughts and feelings through art making.\n\nIn adolescents presenting to the emergency department with a painful condition, our aims are as follows:\n\nAim #1: To determine the degree that art therapy intervention reduces pain and anxiety.\n\nAim #2: To determine the degree that art therapy reduces pain and anxiety 1 hour after the intervention.\n\nAim #3: To explore the qualitative experience of patients undergoing art therapy intervention."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Pain is one of the most common reasons for patients to visit the emergency department (ED), and can be treated using both complementary and pharmacological strategies. However, children are often undertreated for pain which results in not only short term problems, but long term consequences such as trauma and stress-induced disorders; health care avoidance as adults; increased pain sensitivity; and decreased response to future analgesia. There have been variable efforts made to improve the ED management of pain in children, but adolescents are frequently overlooked. A review of the literature revealed that art therapy for pain management in adolescents is understudied. The majority of studies describe the effects of art therapy on the emotional well-being in surgical and oncology populations in adults and children. The studies that did evaluate the effectiveness of art therapy for pain management in children focused primarily on surgical and medical oncology populations with children aged 2-14 years. Of these studies, none evaluated adolescents in the ED, which is a high volume and high stress environment that confers a distinct experience for patients compared to other medical settings. Evaluation of art therapy interventions using quantitative self-report measures with strong validity in children and further delineation of the patient experience related to art therapy is necessary. Advanced evaluation of aforementioned interventions would expand the evidence base needed to describe effectiveness of these interventions and support greater implementation and dissemination. These are the gaps in knowledge that the investigators aim to fill with the proposed study."

          "The investigators propose to conduct a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) pilot feasibility study to inform implementation of a future full-scale SMART design that will be used to construct adaptive biobehavioral sleep intervention strategies involving melatonin, a behavioral sleep intervention (The Bedtime Bank), and their combination for the management of sleep disturbance in adolescents with NDDs. SMARTs allow for a 3-arm trial offering a significant advantage in comparing interventions and combinations of interventions within a single study design. First, participants are randomly assigned to either melatonin or The Bedtime Bank. Response (>/= 18 minute nightly increase in total sleep time [TST]) will be measured at Week 4 and 8. Participants who respond remain on the assigned treatment. Participants who are non-responsive are re-randomized to a different treatment option. To the knowledge of the investigators, a clinically meaningful increase in TST has not been reported in children. However, a nightly increase of 18 minutes in TST has been reported to improve school-performance. After a careful review of the literature, investigators chose to aim for a nightly increase of 18 minutes as a meaningful increase in TST."

          "The body has different ways of fighting infections and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are molecules that fight infections and protect your body from diseases caused by bacteria and toxic substances. Antibodies work by sticking to those bacteria or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been enough to cure most patients. This study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies in order to create a more effective treatment. The treatment that is being researched is called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells (CAR) cells targeted against the disialoganglioside (GD2) antigen that express Interleukin (IL)-15, and the inducible caspase 9 safety switch (iC9), also known as iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T cells.\n\nIn previous studies, it has been shown that when T cells have part of an antibody attached to them they are better at recognizing and killing cancer cells. The antibody that will be used in this study is called anti-GD2. This antibody floats around in the blood and can detect and stick to cancer cells called neuroblastoma cells because they have a substance on the outside of the cells called GD2. For this study, the anti-GD2 antibody has been changed so instead of floating freely in the blood, it is now joined to the T cells. However, it is unknown how long the iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T cells last in the body, so their chances of fighting cancer cells are not well known.\n\nTo improve the tumor fighting power of GD2-CAR-T cells, our researchers have added two additional components to these cells. The IL-15 gene was added so that the GD2-CAR-T cells can attack tumor cells more effectively. Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a chemical that cells use to communicate with one another. Other research using IL-15 in combination with CAR-T cells has shown there is an increase in the body's ability to allow the CAR-T cells to survive and grow in the body. The iC9 gene was added as an \"off switch\" so it can stop the activity of the GD2-CAR-T cells if you experience any serious bad side effects. Bad side effects seen previously in patients receiving the GD2 antibody alone include pain. In this study, the \"stop switch\" can be used to turn off the GD2-CAR-T cells if you experience intense pain that does not respond to normal pain treatments.\n\nThe primary purpose of this study is to determine whether receiving iC9.GD2.IL-15 T cells is safe and tolerable in patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "We plan to conduct a single center, open-label, Phase I clinical trial to establish a safe dose (i.e., number of cells/kg) of autologous iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T-cells in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. The study will enroll a minimum of 10 subjects; all subjects will undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to the cell infusion as outlined in section 4.2.2. The continual reassessment method (CRM) will be used to estimate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of cells that can be administered in dose escalation cohorts comprised of 2-6 subjects. The final MTD will be the dose with estimated probability of DLT closest to the target toxicity rate of 20%. The three cell doses that will be evaluated are outlined in the table below starting at the lowest dose level 1: 0.5 x 106 CAR+ cells/kg iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T cells. Cohort enrollment will be staggered and each subject must complete at least 2 weeks of cell treatment without incident of DLT before another subject can be enrolled at that dose level. A minimum of two subjects must complete the 4-week post-infusion DLT safety assessment period before cohort enrollment of subjects at the next higher dose level will be considered. If dose level 1 is determined to be above a tolerable dose, de-escalation would occur to dose level -1 where subjects would receive 0.25 x 106 CAR+ cells/kg. After dose escalation is completed, an expansion cohort will enroll up to 8 subjects at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to further assess the safety and efficacy of iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T-cells. In the expansion phase, subjects will receive iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T-cells at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) with lymphodepletion given prior to a cell product administration.\n\nCell Procurement\n\nUp to 3 mL/kg of peripheral blood will be obtained (in up to 3 collections) from patients for cell procurement. For subjects with inadequate lymphocyte count or who are unable to donate adequate amounts of peripheral blood, a leukopheresis may be performed to isolate sufficient T cells. The parameters for pheresis will be up to 2 blood volumes. Approximately 4-6 weeks later, subjects for whom cells have been successfully generated and who meet eligibility criteria for lymphodepletion will undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy.\n\nLymphodepleting Regimen\n\nAll subjects will be given lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. This will consist of four days total and should be timed to be completed 2-14 days before planned infusion of CAR T-cells.\n\nCyclophosphamide will be given IV 500 mg/m2/day on days 1-2 and fludarabine will be given IV 30 mg/m2/day on days 1-4. No mesna will be required, although it may be used at investigator discretion.\n\nAdministration of iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T cells\n\nPost lymphodepletion, subjects who meet eligibility criteria for cellular therapy will receive iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T cells within 2-14 days after completing the lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen. We will administer T-cells post lymphodepletion as dosed above.\n\nAfter dose escalation is completed, an expansion cohort will enroll up to 8 subjects to further assess the safety and efficacy of iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T-cells. In the expansion phase, patients who meet criteria outlined in Section 4.2.5 will be allowed to receive a second cell infusion.\n\nDuration of Therapy\n\nTherapy in LCCC 1743-ATL involves infusion of iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 CAR T cells. Treatment will be administered unless:\n\nSubject decides to withdraw from study treatment, or\nGeneral or specific changes in the subject's condition render the subject unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.\nSubject is ineligible for a second infusion\n\nDuration of Follow-up\n\nSubjects will be followed for up to 15 years for RCR evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first. In addition to this follow-up, subjects removed from study treatment for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.\n\nSubjects who receive new therapy after receiving a cell infusion will still be required to complete abbreviated follow up procedures."

          "This is a prospective observational follow-up study of children enrolled in a single center randomized controlled trial (REDvent).\n\nNearly 50% of adult Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors are left with significant abnormalities in pulmonary, physical, neurocognitive function and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) which may persist for years.Data in pediatric ARDS (PARDS) survivors is limited. More importantly, there are no data identifying potentially modifiable factors during ICU care which are associated with long term impairments, which may include medication choices, or complications from mechanical ventilator (MV) management in the ICU including ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) or ventilator induced diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD).\n\nThe Real-time effort driven ventilator (REDvent) trial is testing a ventialtor management algorithm which may prevent VIDD and VILI. VIDD and VILI have strong biologic plausibility to affect the post-ICU health of children with likely sustained effects on lung repair and muscle strength. Moreover, common medication choices (i.e. neuromuscular blockade, corticosteroids) or other complications in the ICU (i.e. delirium) are likely to have independent effects on the long term health of these children. This proposed study will obtain serial follow-up of subjects enrolled in REDvent (intervention and control patients). The central hypothesis is that preventing VIDD, VILI and shortening time on MV will have a measureable impact on longer term function by mitigating abnormalities in pulmonary function (PFTs), neurocognitive function and emotional health, functional status and HRQL after hospital discharge for children with PARDS.\n\nFor all domains, the investigators will determine the frequency, severity and trajectory of recovery of abnormalities amongst PARDS survivors after ICU discharge, identify risk factors for their development, and determine if they are prevented by REDvent. They will leverage the detailed and study specific respiratory physiology data being obtained in REDvent, and use a variety of multi-variable models for comprehensive analysis. Completion of this study will enable the investigators to identify ICU related therapies associated with poor long term outcome, and determine whether they can be mitigated by REDvent."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Background and Significance: Through advancements in critical care, PARDS mortality has decreased from 50% to less than 20%. Therapeutic strategies for PARDS have sought to improve survival, but have often ignored morbidity, despite extensive evidence that nearly 50% of adult ARDS survivors are left with significant abnormalities in pulmonary, physical, neurocognitive function and HRQL which may persist for years. Recent data highlight that approximately 20% of children with respiratory failure have low HRQL 6 months after ICU discharge, and 30% screen positive for post-traumatic stress (PTS). There are virtually no data regarding pulmonary and neurocognitive deficits in PARDS survivors. More importantly, there are no data identifying potentially modifiable factors during ICU care which are associated with long term impairments.\n\nIt is increasingly recognized that ARDS ventilator management is associated with VIDD and VILI, which increase length of MV and failed extubation.REDvent is currently testing whether a MV strategy which uses esophageal manometry to target physiologic levels of patient effort can prevent VIDD and shorten length of MV. In addition, the REDvent strategy results in more lung protective management of Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP), Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP), and Delta Pressure (DP) which may prevent VILI. While the REDvent study is designed for ICU related outcomes, there is strong biologic plausibility that the REDvent strategy can improve long-term outcome. The investigators propose serial follow up of subjects enrolled in the REDvent study (intervention and control patients) which will leverage the infrastructure and data of an already enrolling clinical trial to fill crucial knowledge gaps regarding how PARDS survivors recover from critical illness. The central hypothesis is that preventing VIDD, VILI and shortening time on MV will have a measureable impact on longer term function by mitigating abnormalities in pulmonary function (PFT), neurocognitive function and emotional health, functional status and HRQL after ICU discharge for children with PARDS.\n\nStudy Aims:\n\nSpecific Aim (SA1): To determine the frequency, severity and trajectory of recovery of PFT abnormalities amongst PARDS survivors within 6 months of ICU discharge, identify risk factors for their development, and determine if they are prevented by REDvent.\n\nSpecific Aim (SA2): To determine the frequency and severity of impairments in neurocognitive function and emotional health amongst PARDS survivors in the first year after ICU discharge, identify risk factors for their development, and determine if they may be improved by REDvent.\n\nSpecific Aim (SA3): To determine the frequency, severity and trajectory of recovery of respiratory and functional status and HRQL amongst PARDS survivors in the 12 months after ICU discharge, identify risk factors for their development, and determine if they may be improved by REDvent.\n\nStudy Design: This is a prospective observational follow-up study of children enrolled in a single center randomized controlled trial (REDvent; RO1 HL134666, PI: Khemani).\n\nStudy Measurements and Outcomes: Assessments will be made serially from enrollment up to 1 year after ICU discharge . Data gathered from the parent REDvent study during the original course of mechanical ventilation will also be used for analysis, to understand whether ICU specific therapies, management strategies, or severity of illness are associated with long term outcomes.\n\nExpected Sample Size: REDvent plans to enroll 300 children over 4.5 years. 240 children are expected to survive to hospital discharge, 200 (83%) are expected to consent for follow-up, and allowing for 25% dropout, 150 will reach the primary follow-up endpoints.\n\nA1.H1. At least 30% of PARDS survivors will have ventilation inhomogeneity (VI, primary outcome measured with Lung Clearance Index (LCI)) which will persist 6 months after discharge.\n\nAnalysis: LCI more than 7.5 will be considered abnormal for analysis, and is anticipated to will occur in at least 30% of patients. This yields a 95% confidence interval from 23 to 38% assuming 150 patients complete follow-up. Similar analysis is planned for secondary outcomes. Analyses will be stratified by baseline pulmonary status or history of previous pulmonary disease.\n\nA1.H2. ICU management of PEEP and transpulmonary driving pressure will be independently associated with VI after controlling for baseline co-morbidities and PARDS severity.\n\nAnalysis: The primary outcome for this sub aim is abnormal LCI 6 (VI) months after discharge, as above. Analysis will compare median, mean, and extreme (min or max) transpulmonary pressure at PEEP, plateau, and driving pressure during the acute phase of ventilation (prior to the first SBT) stratified by normal or abnormal LCI. Length of exposure to these settings will be modeled by including an interaction between transpulmonary pressure and length of ventilation. All analyses will be adjusted with multivariable models, controlling for PARDS severity, co-morbidities, and other ventilator and ancillary therapy management.\n\nA1.H3. REDvent will be independently associated with lower VI and fewer abnormalities in pulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength.\n\nAnalysis: The investigators will first analyze differences in median LCI between REDvent and control patients using a Mann-Whitney U or t-test. From preliminary data, the investigators anticipate a power >0.8 to detect > 10% improvement in LCI with the expected enrollment (150 patients). They will subsequently construct a multivariable linear regression model on LCI 6 months after ICU discharge to test whether REDvent management remains independently associated with less VI after adjusting for short term-ICU outcome variables. In addition, usual care acute phase arm (lack of REDvent exposure) will be considered as an independent risk factor for abnormal VI in the multivariable logistic regression model described in A1.H2.\n\nA2.H1. At least 30% of previously unimpaired PARDS survivors will have impairment in neurocognitive function 3 months after ICU discharge, and 20% will persist with deficits at 1 year.\n\nAnalysis: As with the previous aim, the primary outcomes are expressed as binary variables for ease of interpretation. The investigators anticipate 100 previously unimpaired children will complete this aim. The primary outcome is neurocognitive function using Batelle-2 or WISC-5. They estimate approximately 40% of children will have impaired neurocognitive function at 3 month follow-up, resulting in a 95% confidence interval from 30% to 50%. Descriptive analysis will be provided by specific domain both as continuous data and categorized as above. Emotional health assessments and PTS analysis will mimic what is presented above for the subset with data available.\n\nA2.H2. Duration of delirium while in the ICU will be independently associated with impaired neurocognitive function.\n\nAnalysis: The primary outcomes will be categorical, evaluated 3 months after discharge. The primary predictor variable is days with delirium (as identified by CAPD score > 9) modeled as an ordinal variable. Additional confounding variables will be considered including length of MV, illness severity, sedation doses, with selection as described in the previous aims. Secondary analysis will generate a linear regression model on the continuous outcome of normalized neurocognitive score from Batelle-2 or WISC-5, and will consider an interaction term based on the tool used for measurement.\n\nA2.H3. Lack REDvent exposure will be independently associated with impaired neurocognitive function.\n\nAnalysis: The investigators will directly examine normalized neurocognitive score between REDvent and control groups using a t-test or MWU test. The percentage of children with abnormal values at 3 months will be compared between the groups with a Chi-Square test. In multivariable linear regression modeling they will examine the independent relationship between REDvent intervention arm and normalized neurocognitive score, using similar methods as detailed above. In addition, usual care acute phase arm (lack of REDvent exposure) will be considered as an independent risk factor in the multivariable logistic regression models described in A2.H2.\n\nA3.H1. At least 25% of PARDS survivors will have a new respiratory requirement, and 40% will have a decline in overall functional status or a significant decrease in HRQL from baseline at 3 months after ICU discharge, and at least 20% of children will persist with a deficit in one of these domains at 12 months.\n\nAnalysis: As with the previous aims, the primary outcomes are expressed as binary variables for ease of interpretation. However, additional analysis will consider all outcomes as continuous variables. The primary outcomes under this aim consider 3 domains: 1) Functional Status decline: FSS 2 or more points above (worse than) baseline 2) HRQL decline: PEDsQL 5 points or more below (worse than) baseline 3) New respiratory requirement (oxygen, positive pressure, respiratory medications, and respiratory therapies). Based on the research presented above, they estimate 40% of children will have impaired HRQL or functional status at 3 month follow-up, with 95% CI ranging from 32% to 48%, and 25% of children will have a new respiratory requirement, with 95% CI ranging from 18.5 to 32.4%. The same analysis will be repeated at 12 month follow-up.\n\nA3.H2. Cumulative exposure to neuromuscular blockade, corticosteroids, length of MV, and delirium will be independently associated with decline in 1) functional status 2) HRQL and 3) new respiratory requirement 3 months after ICU discharge after controlling for PARDS severity, co-morbidities, and other confounding variables.\n\nAnalysis: The primary outcomes will be categorical, as described in the section above (A3.H1), evaluated 3 months after discharge. The primary predictor variables include: days of neuromuscular blockade, days receiving corticosteroids, days with delirium (CAP-D > 9120-124) and days on MV, modeled as ordinal variables. Additional confounding variables will be considered with selection as described in the previous aims. Multiplicative interaction terms will be considered for inclusion (i.e. corticosteroids*neuromuscular blockade).\n\nA3.H3. REDvent will be independently associated with improved recovery to baseline respiratory status, functional status, and HRQL recovery 3 months after ICU discharge.\n\nAnalysis: The investigators will directly examine PEDsQL change from baseline and FSS change from baseline at 3 month follow up in REDvent and control patients using Mann Whitney U tests. The percentage of children reaching baseline pulmonary requirement at 3 months will be compared between the previously stated groups with a Chi-Square test. In multivariable linear regression modeling the investigators will examine the independent relationship between REDvent intervention arms and change in FSS and HRQL outcomes using the methods detailed in the previous aims. In addition, usual care acute phase arm (lack of REDvent exposure) will be considered as an independent risk factor in the multivariable logistic regression models described in A3.H2 on the categorical outcomes described above."

          "Adolescents with single ventricle heart disease (SVHD) (10 males and 10 females) with mild to moderate cognitive impairment will participate in a total of 25 computer-based working memory training sessions, each 30-40 minutes (5 days a week for 5 weeks) supervised by a trained coach. Primary objective is to evaluate the impact of the Cogmed intervention on working memory scores and the secondary objective to assess brain tissue changes with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques, measures of mean diffusivity pre- and post-intervention."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Adolescents with single ventricle heart disease (SVHD) show brain injuries in sites (hippocampus, mammillary bodies, thalamus, and frontal cortices) that are associated with cognitive deficits, in particular working memory. A key component of cognition, and thus, an important influence on academic performance, self-care ability, quality of life, and morbidity and mortality, is working memory. However, it is unclear whether cognition, as well as brain tissue integrity can be improved with cognition intervention. Among available interventions, a possible intervention to improve working memory and brain status in SVHD is Cogmed®, which is an interactive, computer-based intervention, specifically designed for children and young adults, to improve attention and working memory with significant effectiveness in other pediatric conditions associated with brain injury. A unique feature of the Cogmed ® program is the in-home support of trained coaches for the duration of the intervention (5 days/week for 5 weeks), which optimizes adherence and confirms completion of the tasks. The investigators will use a one group pre- post-intervention design, 20 subjects (10 males and 10 females), with inclusion criteria: 14-18 years of age, have undergone surgical palliation, and score 25-10 (mild to moderate cognitive impairment) on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) screener. Using non-invasive brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based mean diffusivity (MD), an MRI measure of tissue integrity, can identify changes in the hippocampus, mammillary bodies, thalamus, and frontal cortices pre- and post- cognitive intervention. Therefore, the specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) examine the impact of Cogmed® intervention on working memory (working memory index [WMI] score from the WRAML2) in adolescents with SVHD (pre- and post-intervention); 2) assess the effect of Cogmed® on brain structural integrity (DTI-based MD procedures) in sites that control memory (hippocampus, mammillary bodies, thalamus, and frontal cortices) in adolescents with SVHD (pre- and post-intervention); and 3) examine if there is an impact of the Cogmed® intervention on cognition and brain tissue integrity based on sex in SVHD.\n\nIn summary, SVHD adolescents have significant cognitive deficits that are linked to brain injury in regions, which control such functions. Intervention to improve cognition and brain injury in SVHD is unclear, but a potential innovative treatment for such symptoms and brain injury is Cogmed®. The information from this pilot study has the potential to revolutionize the clinical treatment specific to cognitive deficits in SVHD and other types of congenital heart defects. In addition, the clinical implications are considerable as improved working memory skill has the potential to increase academic achievement, improve self-care, reduce mortality and morbidity, and increase quality of life in this high risk, growing population."

This process is difficult, subjective, and variable with expertise, and discourages the use of ultrasound.\n\nWe have developed a method to combine live laparoscopic video and laparoscopic ultrasound images to present fused multimodality images on a single display, eliminating the need for mental image correlation. Specifically, the image fusion method, called laparoscopic augmented reality (LapAR), augments the laparoscopic video with ultrasound data when required by surgeons. This study is designed to test this minimal-risk capability in patients referred for relevant laparoscopic procedures."

          "The main hypothesis of this study is to see if children and adolescents with poorly controlled asthma will find the Hailie Smart Inhaler electronic monitoring device is feasible and acceptable, and will result in improved medication adherence and asthma control. Preliminary studies indicate that Adherium's Hailie Smart Inhaler can improve medication adherence rates in children with asthma and reduce the number of days of reliever medication used. It also has been shown to reduce missed days of school and hospitalizations due to asthma exacerbations. The Hailie device is a sleeve that fits over inhalers and uses Bluetooth connection to cell phones to remind patients to take their medication. It also records use of the controller and rescue inhalers, allowing for parents, physicians, and patients to get a fuller and more accurate picture of their adherence to treatment and severity of disease. With improved adherence, asthma control should improve, resulting in a decreased costs and use of services."

          "Advances in modern medicine and critical care interventions have greatly impacted survival of critically ill patients, but these interventions are not without consequences. Although patients may now survive the initial critical illness, these patients may not recover to their pre-illness baseline state of health. Recent data in both the critically ill adult and neonatal patients who survive sepsis or surgical events have been shown to progress to persistent inflammatory, immunosuppressed, catabolic syndrome (PICS). This was first identified in adult trauma patients, and more recently was defined in critically ill neonates. To date, there are no published reports of PICS in the critically ill pediatric population. Our long-term goal is to understand PICS in the pediatric population and how early medical and nutritional interventions may impact overall morbidity and survival. To achieve this goal first PICS must first be characterized in the pediatric population. The hypothesis is that PICS occurs in pediatric patients and is associated with increased time to return to a baseline functional life post-injury or illness. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1: To determine the incidence of PICS in the pediatric population and associate the diagnosis of PICS to survival and time to return to baseline functional life and Specific Aim 2: To determine if early increased inflammatory and immunosuppressive markers are associated with the development of PICS and increased morbidity and mortality. These aims will be accomplished by conducting a prospective single-center observational pilot study to enroll pediatric patients with an anticipated pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) stay greater than 14 days. Through these two aims, the investigators anticipate that this research will provide an explanation into the interplay of inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism in critically ill children, which is imperative to the development of early therapeutic and nutritional interventions that can reduce morbidity and mortality associated with critical illness."

The hypothesize is that PICS occurs in pediatric critically ill patients and is associated with increased time to return to a baseline functional life post-injury or illness.\n\nEnrollment/Randomization This is a prospective observational study with no randomization. The patients will be approached between PICU stay days 9-12 for consent. Labs will be drawn between PICU stay days 12-16 with a preference for PICU day 14, however, labs will be drawn in accordance with the standard of care labs to avoid additional draws.\n\nStudy Procedures\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To determine the incidence of PICS in the pediatric population and associate the diagnosis of PICS to survival and time to return to baseline functional life.\n\nIn order to determine the incidence of PICS in PICU patients, a prospective single-center study will be conducted of all critically ill pediatric patients admitted to PICU at Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health, Indianapolis, IN. Patients will be included if they have an anticipated stay of >14 days in the PICU. Patients will be excluded from this study if they have are maintained on chronic mechanical ventilation, have a known chronic inflammatory disease process, or are diagnosed with failure to thrive or malnutrition upon admission to the PICU.\n\nData to be collected will include demographic data, nutrition data (weight, protein/non-protein calories received, type of nutrition and prescribed goal nutrition by a dietician), severity of illness, length of stay in the PICU and hospital. Existing routine labs from admission and PICU stay including blood counts, electrolytes and nutrition labs will be collected. At 14 days (± 1 day) the patient will be approached for inclusion into the study. At that time, routine labs to check for inflammation and nutritional status such as CRP, total lymphocyte count, albumin, prealbumin, and retinol binding protein will be collected Diagnosis of PICS will be determined when a patient has been admitted to the PICU for >14 days and has signs of both inflammation (CRP >15mg/L) and immunosuppression (total lymphocyte count < 0.80×109/L), as well as catabolism (Serum albumin < 3.0g/dL, Prealbumin <10mg/dL, Retinol binding protein <10μg/dL, and weight loss >10% or body mass index <18 during hospitalization).\n\nData Management:\n\nData will be entered and stored in in a de-identified/HIPAA compliant manner using a password protected web-based database that has securities to protect confidentiality and data integrity. The database will be constructed in REDCap.\n\nData Analysis Plan:\n\nClinical risk factors will be summarized and distributions examined. Relationships between the variables and the development of PICS will be explored using plots, correlation coefficients, and contingency tables. The association between clinical variables, including nutritional interventions, and PICS will then be analyzed with logistic regression. Both univariate and multivariate analyses will be conducted. The significance threshold p-value is set at 0.05.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To determine if early increased inflammatory and immunosuppressive markers are associated with the development of PICS and increased morbidity and mortality.\n\nSample management and processing:\n\nIn addition to CRP and TLC, which will be collected at 14 days (± 1 day) of PICU admission , additional blood samples will be collected at these time points to be frozen for further analysis. At the time of blood collection, an additional 5 mL of blood will be collected, processed, and stored at -80 degree Celsius. Once desired time-points are identified and further funding obtained, samples will be processed in batches to evaluate biochemical markers of inflammation. This will be performed using The Inflammatory Cytokine Human Magnetic 5-Plex Panel for the Luminex™ platform. This will quantify GM-CSF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α in serum samples.\n\nThe expected outcomes will focus on characterizing PICS in the pediatric population and identifying early inflammatory markers that may correlate with the development of PICS and subsequently increased morbidity associated with critical illness. The results are expected to have a positive impact by filling a key gap in the understanding of the mechanism of PICS in critically ill children. This research will provide insight into the interplay of inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism in critically ill children, which is imperative to the development of early therapeutic and nutritional interventions that can reduce morbidity and mortality associated with critical illness."

          "Bladder dysfunction is one of the most important factors influencing duration and quality of life in children with spinal cord injury. Effective bladder control comprises a major aspect of a child's life with SCI and is especially challenging due to the rapid changes in a child's physical and cognitive development. Urological consequences secondary to a neurogenic bladder are responsible for many clinical complications post-spinal cord injury, including repeated urinary tract infections, autonomic dysreflexia, lifelong urologic care, and many hospitalizations. Alternative approaches to bladder management that focus on recovery of function and age-appropriate independence are needed. Prior research findings in our lab in adult participants indicate a benefit of locomotor training on bladder function. The purpose of this study is to determine with quantitative unbiased urodynamic outcome measures if locomotor training, provided to children with spinal cord injury, impacts the developing urinary system."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Our overall hypothesis is that spinal cord injury-induced bladder dysfunction, facilitated by the loss of supra-spinal connections and subsequent alterations of the lumbosacral circuitry, can be ameliorated through activity-based therapy that regulates the state of detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia and normalizes release of neurotrophic factors known to contribute to bladder hyper-reflexia. The primary study aim is to determine the effects of weight-bearing task-specific training for locomotion (stepping on a treadmill) after incomplete and complete spinal cord injury in children on bladder storage, voiding, biomarkers, and quality of life (parent-reported during baseline and exit interview). A secondary aim is to develop a scale for classifying bladder recovery after spinal cord injury based either on the pattern of storage and voiding prior to injury (if the child had bladder control prior to injury) or on established patterns of micturition development (if the child was injured prior to experiencing bladder control)."

          "Children with inadequate intestinal absorption due to loss of large amounts of small bowel require intravenous nutrition (feeding through the vein) to sustain hydration and nutrition to avoid starvation and dehydration; however, intravenous (IV) nutrition can lead to complications including liver failure. Tube feeding directly to the small intestine avoids the complications of IV nutrition, but fats are not fully digestible due to inadequate bowel function. We propose to predigest the fat using a small cartridge attached to the feeding tube to allow for rapid absorption with the possibility of reducing or eliminating the need for intravenous nutrition"
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Project Summary/Abstract\n\nShort bowel syndrome (SBS) is often due to the loss of large amounts of small intestine that compromises digestive absorption. The treatments include (1) a high-calorie diet that includes vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, proteins and fats; (2) injections of vitamins and minerals; (3) administration of drugs to slow the normal movement of the intestine or to increase the surface area of the intestinal lining; and (4) feeding through the vein (i.e., parenteral nutrition or PN). Many patients cannot wean from PN due to reduced intestinal length or function. Patients on long-term PN frequently experience serious metabolic complications, sepsis, hepatic biliary disorders including cholestasis, and fibrosis and can progress to liver failure. Full intestinal feeding (enteral nutrition) without PN is the optimal way to prevent the above complications.\n\nEnterally administered long chain triglycerides in patients with SBS, especially those with hepatic dysfunction, are not well tolerated due to bile acid malabsorption, which leads to decreased micelle formation and fat digestion. The dietary fat is unable to be emulsified by the bile acids and acted on by lipases before exiting the patient as stool. Switching to other forms of fat such as medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) that do not require micelles for absorption may be better tolerated in patients with bile acid or pancreatic insufficiency but are not optimal as they increase the osmotic load in the intestine. This may increase the chance of stool dumping; moreover, MCTs do not contain essential fatty acids (FAs). The ability to provide the essential FAs such as those present in enteral formulas in a form that does not require the formation of micelles for absorption, would allow patients with SBS and those who are no longer PN dependent to receive adequate nutrition and continue to maintain the same growth trajectory as when they received the majority of their nutrition parenterally.\n\nRELiZORB is a digestive enzyme cartridge connected in-line with enteral feed tubing sets designed to mimic the function of pancreatic lipase. It is hypothesized that by using an external lipase device (RELiZORB) enteral nutrition will be better absorbed, and PN dependence reduced as enteral autonomy is increased. This product uniquely eliminates the need for intestinal emulsification and lipase activity and eliminates the risk of drugs, including lipases, allowing absorption at the time the diet enters the gut. The device has been shown to digest >90% of fat in most enteral formulas.\n\nThis is a phase 4, open label single center clinical trial to determine the safety, tolerability, and bioavailability of the RELiZORB enzyme cartridge with enteral nutrition when used daily for 90 days in pediatric subjects with SBS, aged 5 years - 18 years, who are PN dependent. The change in PN calories from baseline, assessed at Day 7, 14, 28, 60, and 90, will be assessed by area under the curve and presented with a 95% confidence interval. The number (percent) of treatment-emergent adverse events, grade 2 or above, will be tabulated. Changes in growth, fecal fat/protein, plasma FAs, PN volume, and enteral/oral nutrition will be described."

          "There is strong evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with exposure is the preferred treatment for youth with anxiety disorders, but outpatient services that provide this type of treatment are limited. Even for those who do have access to anxiety-specific treatment, a traditional outpatient model of treatment delivery may not be suitable. Among the numerous logistical barriers to treatment access and response is the inability to generalize treatment tools to settings outside of the office. Patient-centered (home-based or telehealth; patient-centered telehealth closed as of 5/1/21) treatment models that target symptoms in the context in which they occur could be more effective, efficient, and accessible for families. The present study aims to compare the efficacy, efficiency, and feasibility of patient centered home-based CBT and patient centered telehealth CBT with a traditional office-based model of care. The question proposed, including proposed outcomes, have been generated and developed by a group of hospital, payer, patient and family stakeholders who will also contribute to the iterative process of protocol revision. The investigators anticipate 379 anxious youth to be randomized to receive outpatient treatment using telehealth (patient-centered telehealth closed as of 5/1/21), home-based services, or treatment as usual using a traditional outpatient model. Results of this study are expected to provide evidence for the efficacy and efficiency of patient-centered treatment, as well as increase treatment access and family engagement in the treatment process."

          "Anxiety disorders are a significant public health problem that cause suffering for youth and their families, derail normal childhood development, and when left untreated persist into adulthood with high societal costs. Cognitive Behavioral Treatment (CBT) including exposure therapy is the treatment of choice, yet multiple barriers limit access to care. Even for families with access to care, traditional provider-centered (office based) treatment presents challenges and can limit effectiveness for many youth and families. Home- and Community-based exposure therapy is efficacious for patients who previously did not improve with provider-centered services, and input from family stakeholders suggests that treatment in these settings is an optimal match for their needs. Patient-centered models involving home visits and provider teams have consistently demonstrated increased treatment accessibility and engagement. However, there has been no comprehensive comparison of exposure delivered by patient-centered teams using home visits versus by provider-centered office visits alone for childhood anxiety. The absence of comparative effectiveness research (CER) data impedes targeted use of patient centered versus traditional outpatient treatment and would better allocate limited resources, provide the best quality care, and help patients and families make educated decisions about their treatment choices. Telehealth has strong evidence for effectiveness for youth with anxiety and OCD when delivered by a licensed provider, with treatment responder rates ranging from 73-82% (Carpenter, et al., 2018; Comer et al., 2017; Storch et al., 2011). Although traditional telehealth treatments can address barriers associated with in-person treatment, it has yet to be leveraged to increase service capacity. The overall goal of this proposal is to compare two models of service delivery, patient-centered delivery (utilizing novel deployment of personnel both in-home and via telehealth, patient-centered telehealth closed as of 5/1/21) vs. traditional provider-centered delivery, of CBT in youth ages 5-18 receiving exposure therapy for anxiety. A total of 379 children will be treated, with 166 (or 167) children randomly assigned to provider-centered, 166 (or 167) assigned to patient-centered in-home, and 46 assigned to patient-centered telehealth treatment conditions. The patient-centered telehealth condition was added in 2020 in response the COVID-19 global pandemic and closed when the recruitment goal was reached in May 2021. Telehealth treatment models are a necessary health system adaptation in the current health crisis, but also may improve access to care post pandemic. We hope including telehealth as a comparator in our service delivery compared effectiveness trial will be highly informative and relevant for the future mental healthcare landscape.\n\nA trained independent evaluator (IE) blind to condition will measure patient and family treatment engagement, anxiety symptoms/severity, and functional impairment at baseline, during active treatment at weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24, and 3- and 6-month follow-up after acute treatment. The primary aims are to compare the relative effectiveness of patient-centered vs. provider-centered treatment for: 1) improving family treatment engagement/satisfaction, 2) reducing anxiety symptoms, and 3) reducing associated disability (quality of life and functional impairment). Secondary outcomes are to understand moderators of treatment response including: severity of illness, caregiver burden/family accommodation, and barriers to treatment access and to explore group differences in time course of response, durability of treatment gains, provider volume/capacity and efficiency in patient centered versus provider centered treatment."

          "Background\n\nAs noted above, EMPOWER was a multi-disciplinary, team-based clinic model, involving physicians, psychologists, registered dietitians (RDs), and physical therapists (PTs) providing tertiary care management of obesity. Data from the first two years of EMPOWER showed that patients with four or more visits (n=109) experienced a decrease in average BMI z-score (-0.09SD). This, though modest, is promising; however, both cost and patient retention present significant challenges to EMPOWER and other tertiary care pediatric obesity programs, and may be barriers to further progress. Much administrative personnel time was consumed in working with insurers in order to authorize visits, and nevertheless, this type of hospital-based care was poorly reimbursed. Getting to Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) is often a major challenge for our patients, due to the large urban sprawl of Los Angeles, traffic, limited and expensive parking, and poor public transportation. Frequent visits result in missed work and school days, a burden to families. Adolescent patients face even greater challenges, as they learn to manage their own health and balance the emotional and social changes required in the transition to adulthood, with family and parental expectations and limitations.\n\nTelehealth technology presents an innovative, cost-effective, and often highly-engaging alternative to in-person visits, which bypasses many of the logistical difficulties of getting to CHLA. Moreover, adolescents today are highly attuned to, and aligned with, digital and mobile technologies, and are natural consumers of media in this format. There is strong evidence from numerous published studies that telehealth can be an effective tool for chronic disease management. Additionally, many youth with obesity are significantly socially isolated, and our current individual patient-provider model does not effectively address this isolation in the way we expect a group session will; various published studies of group treatment have demonstrated inter-participant support and positive effects of social interaction.\n\nWhile Empower's current model leads to successful weight management in many of its patients, that success is often modest, as alluded to above; and for some of patients, it simply does not work. With this study, the investigators intend to pilot a group telehealth model targeted at adolescents with obesity.\n\nSpecifically, the investigators aim to:\n\nPilot a new care delivery model for CHLA EMPOWER patients using group telehealth visits.\nAssess the feasibility of using telehealth with adolescent patients\nTest the efficacy of group health education sessions using video conference technology\n\nHypotheses:\n\nUse of group health education sessions using video conference technology is a feasible, cost-effective care delivery model for adolescents being treated for obesity.\n\nEfficacy of this model will be comparable to, or better than, standard multi-disciplinary in-person visits. This will be measured by:\n\na. Clinical and anthropomorphic data: i. Changes in Body Mass Index (BMI), BMI percentile, and BMI percent of the 95th percentile ii. Change in blood pressure percentile iii. Change in hemoglobin A1C, ALT, triglycerides b. Quality of life c. Self-efficacy d. Satisfaction\n\nAttendance to telehealth visits will be better than attendance to standard in-person visits, as measured by no-show rates and same-day reschedules\n\nMethods and study design:\n\nYouth 14-18 years of age who meet EMPOWER clinic criteria and consent to the study will be prospectively assigned to the intervention telehealth group (n=24); they will be compared to a restrospective cohort of \"standard care\" EMPOWER patients (n=24). Since the investigators do not expect a statistically significant difference in BMI change between the telehealth intervention and standard EMPOWER, power calculations were conducted on change scores in Quality of Life indicators. Using Optimal Design software v1.77 and specifying a = 0.05, anticipated effect size δ = 0.40, between-group variance ranging around 0.05, and controlling for effects of the covariates on various measures at 3 and 6 months, it is expected that 24 participants per condition will provide a moderate power to identify a treatment effect for proof of concept purposes.\n\nThe intervention group will receive:\n\nGroup telehealth sessions twice per month for 6 months. The group sessions will be 60 minutes and involve delivery of a semi-structured curriculum including topics such as nutrition education, reducing barriers to physical activity, and mindfulness techniques. Sessions will be facilitated by EMPOWER providers (physicians, psychologists, RDs, and PTs) who will use a combination of: 1) motivational interviewing techniques, modified for the group setting, 2) supportive exploration of barriers to behavior change and 3) setting SMART goals.\nBrief individualized coaching by the program coordinator between sessions via telephone or email. It will be comparable to the personalized feedback and motivation provided in standard EMPOWER.\nParent newsletters will be sent out monthly to inform parents of key messages; parents will also be informed of their child's attendance to the session\n\nControl subjects received the standard EMPOWER model consisting of monthly in person clinic visits where they met individually with a combination of providers (physician, RD, PT, and/or psychologist).\n\nThe intervention group participants will have in-person visits at baseline, 3 and 6 months to measure weight, vertical growth, and blood pressure, and complete questionnaires assessing quality of life, self-efficacy and satisfaction. Anthropomorphic measures and attendance rates will be compared to the retrospective control group."

          "New and creative approaches are needed to address childhood obesity. Current strategies result in suboptimal outcomes and are intensive and costly. It has been theorized that overeating, may have addictive qualities, although few weight management interventions have tested therapeutic techniques founded on addiction medicine principles, such as, withdrawal, tolerance and craving control1, 2. A pilot study utilizing an addiction model based mobile health (mHealth) weight-loss intervention in adolescents showed that the app intervention reduced BMI Z-score (zBMI) to a greater extent than youth participating in an in-clinic multidisciplinary weight management intervention, and appeared to be a cost-effective, labor efficient method for adolescent weight management.\n\nThe proposed multi-site randomized control trial (RCT) will test the effectiveness of an addiction-based weight loss intervention, embodied first as a smartphone app with telephone coaching and second as an identical approach phone-coaching alone intervention compared to age matched controls participating in an in-clinic weight management interventions in a larger sample of economically, racially and ethnically diverse adolescents (ages 14-18).\n\nOne hundred and eighty adolescents will be recruited from pediatric interdisciplinary weight management clinics operating out of five different hospital systems in Southern California and through targeted mailing to 40 ethnically, racially and economically diverse neighborhoods in Los Angeles County. The adolescents will be randomized 1:1 via stratified block randomization to either receive 1) interactive addiction model based mobile health (mHealth) weight-loss intervention with personalized phone-coaching (AppCoach), 2) interactive addiction model based mHealth weight-loss intervention alone (App) or 3) Multidisciplinary in-clinic weight management program (Clinic). Assessment of the intervention's effect on zBMI and percent over the 95th percentile (%BMIp95), fasting metabolic parameters, addictive eating habits, executive function, and motivation for change will be obtained at enrollment, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months (1 year post intervention follow up). In addition, a real-life economic analysis (cost, cost-saving and non-monetary benefits) analysis will be completed comparing AppCoach to 1) App and 2) Clinic. We will further explore whether primary and secondary outcomes differ by race and whether race moderates the relationship between initial intervention efficacy and prolonged weight maintenance."

Post-operative pain management regimens are often at the discretions of the attending surgeon and may include opiods, patient administered analgesia (PCA), epidural catheters, subcutaneous analgesia catheters or NSAIDS to control incisional pain. Currently, both epidural or subcutaneous analgesia catheters (On-Q pumps) are commonly used for children undergoing these operations, at the discretion of the surgeon. There are no studies comparing these regimens in children. The purpose of this study is to compare postoperative pain control of the two strategies."

The patient and treating team will be blinded to the pain control device. The primary outcome is additional narcotic usage for 3 post-operative days, and secondary outcomes are pain scores for 3 post-operative days, post-surgical day of ambulation, time to regular diet, infectious complications (UTI, wound infection or pneumonia), and hospital length of stay. Outcomes from both groups will be directly compared in order to determine whether one strategy provides more effective pain control with less complications than the other, or whether they are equivalent."

In this project the investigators will focus on oxycodone, a standard and preferred post-surgical oral analgesic in children\n\nThe purpose of this research is to study serious immediate and long-term clinical problems from both surgical pain and oxycodone use in children and adolescents to improve the safety and effectiveness of surgical pain relief.\n\nThe long-term goals are to improve the safety and effectiveness of surgical pain relief with opioids (a class of drugs/pain relievers) and to minimize the societal burden of disabling Chronic Persistent Surgical Pain (CPSP, which is pain that persists even after the expected healing time from surgery) and Opioid Dependence (OD) by preoperative risk predictions and personalized care with the right dose of the right pain medication for each child.\n\nThe overall objective is to determine the impact of risk factors on oxycodone's immediate and long-term negative postoperative outcomes and to personalize dosing in children undergoing outpatient and major inpatient surgery."

          "Newborns and children with life-threatening heart and lung failure may require support with ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). With ECMO, oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged and circulated throughout the body even if the heart is unable to do so. Unfortunately, ECMO can cause breakdown of the red blood cells (known as hemolysis). For unclear reasons, newborns are at particularly high risk of hemolysis while being supported by ECMO. The amount of hemolysis is measured with concentrations of a breakdown product from red blood cells known as free hemoglobin. One possible reason for high free hemoglobin levels in newborns on ECMO could be related to another blood protein called haptoglobin. Haptoglobin is known to help in clearing free hemoglobin through the kidneys into the urine. However, haptoglobin levels in newborns can be very low and increases slowly during the first few months of life. Free hemoglobin may be inappropriately high in newborns supported by ECMO because of low levels of haptoglobin. The purpose of this study is to characterize haptoglobin, free hemoglobin, and hemolysis in newborns and children supported by ECMO and compare those values to age-matched newborns and children not on ECMO."

Participants will be randomly assigned to a study group where they will receive ketorolac in addition to the standard of care treatment or will receive only the standard of care pain management. The researchers hypothesize that by administering ketorolac at the end of the procedure once hemostasis has been achieved, it will be possible to decrease the amount of morphine administered in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). This study aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the efficacy and safety of the current standard post-operative analgesic regimen employed at the study institution, in which opioid analgesia currently plays a prominent role."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as an indication for adenotonsillectomy has increased significantly over the past ten years, and now has surpassed recurrent tonsillitis as the most common indication for this procedure. Opioids continue to be the most commonly administered pain medication for these procedures. Studies have shown that patients with OSA have significantly increased sensitivity to opioids that results in post-operative respiratory depression and apnea when administered via standard opioid dosing protocols. Children with OSA were shown to have a nearly fivefold increase in the odds of developing respiratory complications when compared to their counterparts with tonsillitis. Ketorolac possesses similar efficacy to morphine without the problematic complications of respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting, which are commonly seen post-adenotonsillectomy. Importantly, when combined with opioids, ketorolac is opioid-sparing. This synergistic effect means that a similar level of analgesia is achieved using a lower dose of opioid. However, there continues to be concern about using ketorolac due to the potential risk of post-operative bleeding from anti-platelet activity.\n\nThis randomized, prospective study aims to determine the effect of ketorolac on the total dose of morphine required to achieve postoperative analgesia in children with OSA undergoing adenotonsillectomy. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive ketorolac or to not receive ketorolac. The post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) nurses, who will be blinded to ketorolac administration, will evaluate the patients using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scale scores at 10 minutes post-op, 20 minutes post-op and at time of PACU discharge. For patients with a FLACC score of 6-10, morphine (0.05mg/kg) will be administered. For patients with FLACC scores of 3-5, morphine (0.025mg/kg) will be administered. The total amount of opioid required to obtain a FLACC score of less than 3 will be evaluated as the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes to be evaluated will be PACU FLACC scores, time required in PACU, incidence of post-tonsillectomy bleeding and total pain medications administered during hospital admission."

          "Following a gluten-free diet is difficult. Eating small amounts of gluten may be common. Gluten may cause a wide range of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. Thus, there is not always a 'feedback loop' to alert to accidental gluten exposure. Nevertheless, these \"silent\" gluten exposures may interfere with recovery and healing of the intestine. New tools are available to test for fragments of gluten - Gluten Immunogenic Peptides (GIPs) in urine and stool.\n\nThe goal of this research study is to evaluate how knowledge of gluten-immunogenic peptide (GIP) levels in urine and stool affects subsequent adherence to a gluten-free diet. Participants will be children with celiac disease recruited at Boston Children's Hospital. All participants will undergo a diet assessment by a dietitian at the beginning and end of the study. At random intervals, participants will be prompted to collect their next urine sample and complete a survey related to symptoms and diet adherence. Half of the participants will store the sample to be tested later and the rest of the participants will be provided with devices to test their urine at home to receive immediate results. Participants in the home testing group will also be given a set of stool tests (x4) to use at their own discretion during the study period, and will report results and reasons for test use to the research team. GIP test results will be compared to other measures of celiac disease and gluten-free diet adherence, including antibody tests. These findings will help to determine how these new tools can be used to improve gluten-free diet adherence and symptoms and the effect on quality of life."

        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy is an elective operation, mainly in the pediatric population. This procedure is performed by Dr. Jason Mouzakes and the otolaryngology residents under his supervision. The location of the research is at the Albany Medical Center Hospital, Main Campus and South Clinical Campus. Duration of this study for each individual patient will be set at 14 days post procedure, taking into account that bleeding risk with this procedure is highest within the first 2 weeks post-operatively. Data will be obtained within 90 days after discharge from the hospital by telephone interview with the parents or hospital record. The investigators plan to enroll at least 600 patients, 300 in each group, ASA physical status I to III and age 2 years to 18 years old (inclusive). Parents and children may be informed about the study at the time when surgery is planned during initial office visit. Enrollment in the study will be done on the day of the surgery, after the Anesthesiologist or Otolaryngology/Anesthesiology Resident explains the purpose, benefits and possible risks of the study and answers all questions of the parents. Before enrollment is finalized, informed consent and informed assent, if applicable, to take part in a human research study will be obtained.\n\nAt the completion of surgery, patients will be transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Additional pain medication if needed in the PACU will be acetaminophen 15mg/kg oral solution or opioid medications at discretion of treating anesthesiologist. Acetaminophen will only be given in PACU if it was not received pre-operatively. Patients will be discharged to home from the PACU or 2nd level short-stay recovery unit (at South Clinical Campus) when standard criteria are met for each patient per protocol.\n\nRandomization Plan:\n\nPatients will be randomized by a card system. There will be 600 cards with 300 labeled (K) for ketorolac group and 300 labeled (NS) for placebo group along with the assigned subject number. Preservative free 0.9% normal saline will be used as placebo. Randomization will be done using www.randomization.com which will generate a randomization sequence with a concealed blocking schedule. A non-investigator will prepare envelopes numbered sequentially, each containing a card indicating the subject number (sequentially numbered 1 - 600) and group as randomized by above plan. Envelopes are opened only upon obtaining consent maintaining allocation concealment until treatment is initiated. Patients are therefore assigned a subject number at the initiation of the study. The non-treating anesthesiologist will open the next sequential envelope (starting from envelope #1) and draw up the specified drug and give the drug with a patient label to the treating anesthesiologist. The non-treating anesthesiologist will also tell the treating anesthesiologist the patient's subject number so it may be recorded on the individual data collection sheet. The non-treating anesthesiologist will place a patient label on the drug card and store the card in the anesthesiology office, specifically Dr Afroze's office inside of room D108. Dr Afroze's office is locked and has minimal access. The patient drug cards will be accessed by the research team two weeks after the surgery date to record patient data.\n\nThe PACU nurses, surgeon, residents, and treating anesthesiologist will all be blinded and may perform the PACU scoring and data collection. Study drugs will be documented the same exact way on the anesthesia records for all the study patients. All the study patients' charts will have both drugs documented as IN study drug dose in mg. The doses of the drugs are pre-calculated based on the patient's weight and will be drawn by a non-treating anesthesiologist and administered by the treating anesthesiologist at the time of the surgery.\n\nPatients for our study will be recruited from the Pediatric ENT clinical practice of Dr. Mouzakes. Surgery, anesthesia, and postoperative recovery will take place at the Albany Medical Center Hospital, Main Campus and South Clinical Campus. The investigators plan to enroll 600 children, age of 2 to 18 years old (inclusive) and ASA physical status I to III. The investigators anticipate completing our study in 12 to 24 months.\n\nThis study will have power of 81% to show that the bleeding rate for new treatment (ketorolac) is at least as low as the event rate for the control group. This assumes that the true event rates for the active control and new treatment populations are precisely equal (at 2.0%), that a difference of 3.0% or less is unimportant, that the sample size in the two groups will be 280 and 280, and that alpha (1 tailed) is set at .05.\n\nFormally, the null hypothesis is that the event rate for new treatment is 3.0 percentage points higher than the event rate for active control, and the study has power of 81.3% to reject this null. Equivalently, the likelihood is 81.3% that the 95.0% confidence interval for the difference in event rates will exclude a 3.0 point difference in favor of active control.\n\nThe primary endpoint, bleeding rates, will be compared between the two groups by Chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test if expected values are 5 or less). Other secondary categorical data (readmission, PACU nausea/vomitting) will be analyzed similarly. Continuous data (opioid administrations, PACU pain scores, length of stay in recovery units) will be compared with an independent sample t-test or Mann-Whitney test if data demonstrates significant non-normality. Multivariable analysis will be used to determine if bleeding is associated with the covariates age, gender, weight, ASA status, and primary or secondary diagnoses.\n\nThe risks of the study include the risks of possible allergic reactions to ketorolac in patients with no previously known drugs allergies, and possible decreased pain control for some patients. However, as is standard of practice, all patients with uncontrolled post-operative pain will have additional acetaminophen or opioid medications administered as needed for pain in the post-operative units under the guidance of the treating anesthesiologist. As previously demonstrated, ketorolac intravenous & intramuscular have been shown in the anesthesiology literature to be safe with a low incidence of side effects. Patient's parents will be informed of other possible side effects of ketorolac including platelet dysfunction with prolonged bleeding at operative site, gastrointestinal bleeding, and renal dysfunction. There are no described long term side effects from single intraoperative application of ketorolac. Side-effects that have been noticed in other studies are minimal and transient. Patient's parents will have access to the investigator and ER department 24 hours a day, 7 days a week if any concerns appear.\n\nThe major benefit from IV ketorolac for patients is potential of adequate pain control for tonsillectomy with decreased use of opioid analgesia, ameliorating possible negative side effects of narcotics such as respiratory depression and nausea/vomiting. Achieving adequate pain control in tonsillectomy patients leads to improved oral intake and decreased risk of dehydration. Additionally, results of this study will be contributing to improvement in pain management for future patients undergoing tonsillectomy surgery. Overall, The investigators feel that the risks involved with this study are minimal and potential benefits are quite large.\n\nThe PHI to be collected includes the medical record number and date of birth to identify the range of age of the participants, possible allergy to medications, and brief past medical history relevant to the study.\n\nIf consent is not obtained, the patient will not be included in the study and will receive standard assessment and care, which typically includes single dose 0.5mg/ kg ketorolac at the completion of the procedure and additional pain medications in recovery areas as needed, such as acetaminophen or opioids. At any point in the study, the subject may choose to discontinue participation and opt for standard treatment."

          "Pulp re-vascularization/regeneration is a procedure performed to allow pulpal stem cells to survive and/or differentiate to allow immature tooth root structures to grow to full maturity. Currently, the procedure includes disinfection of the necrotic root canal space and induction of bleeding to potentiate pulpal stem cell differentiation to allow root growth on an immature root. A number of studies conducted previously demonstrate that N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) potentiates differentiation of pulpal stem/stromal cells and protects pulpal cells from apoptosis. 14-18 human subjects will be recruited forming two groups where pulp re-vascularization/regeneration procedures will be performed with or without the use of NAC treatment prior to induction of bleeding. Recall follow-up appointments will be done at 6 months and 1 year post treatment with subsequent yearly appointments until full root growth has been achieved."

          "We will recruit 14-18 patients under the age of 18 by means of advertising at UCLA. Two groups will be formed, one with NAC treatment during endodontic revascularization and one without. Each patient will have an adult tooth where the following criteria are met:\n\nTooth with necrotic pulp and immature apex(apices)\nPulp space is not needed for post/core, final restoration\nCompliant patient who is willing to come for at least 2-3 treatment appointments and 2-3 follow-up recall appointments.\nPatients are not allergic to calcium hydroxide intra-canal medicament\n\nAppropriate consent forms will be obtained by the patient and the patient's parent or legal guardian. If we recruit 18 patient, 9 patients will be under regenerative endodontic therapy/re-vascularization with NAC and 9 patients without NAC.\n\nThe following procedures will be applied to the patients.\n\nFirst Appointment:\n\nLocal anesthesia administration, dental dam isolation and access\nCopious, gentle irrigation with 20mL NaOCL (sodium hypochlorite) using an irrigation system that minimizes the possibility of extrusion of irrigants into the periapical spaces. The concentration of NaOCL will be low (1.5%, 20mL/canal for 5 minutes). Afterwards, irrigation with 17% EDTA (20mL/canal for 5 minutes) will be done. Irrigating needle position should be about 1mm from root end, to minimize cytotoxicity to stem cells in the apical tissues.\nDry canals with paper points\nPlace calcium hydroxide into canal(s) delivered via syringe\nSeal access with 3-4mm of a temporary restorative material such as CavitTM, IRMTM or glass ionomer. Dismiss patient for 2-4 weeks.\n\nSecond Appointment:\n\nAssess response to initial treatment. If there are signs/symptoms of persistent infection, consider repeating the procedures of the First appointment.\nAnesthesia with 3% mepivacaine without vasoconstrictor, dental dam isolation\nCopious gentle irrigation with 20mL of 17% EDTA\nTake a radiograph to ensure previous calcium hydroxide has been fully removed form the canal system\nDry with paper points\nFor study patients only: Irrigate canal system with NAC (20mM NAC, 30mL/canal) gently for 10 minutes and then dry canal(s) with paper points\nCreate bleeding into the canal system by over-instrumenting (endo file, endo explorer). Induce bleeding by rotating a pre-curved (approximately 45 degrees at the apical 1-2mm of file) K-file at 2mm past the apical foramen with the goal of having the entire canal filled with blood to the level of the cemento-enamel junction.\nStop the bleeding at a level that allows for 3-4mm of restorative material. Place a resorbable matrix (CollaPlugTM, CollacoteTM, CollatTapeTM) over the blood clot if necessary to achieve a better stop for mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) or Bioceramic fast set putty (BC). Place white MTA as capping material on top of the resorbable matrix.\nThe access is closed with 3-4mm layer of glass ionomer (Fuji IXTM, GC America, Alsip, IL), composite or alloy over the capping material. For resin modified glass ionomers and composite, 40 seconds of light curer will be done.\n\nFollow-up recall appointments: Clinical and Radiographic exam\n\nExtra-oral examination: No pain, extra-oral swelling nor extra-oral sinus tract\nIntra-oral examination: No pain, intra-oral swelling of mucosa nor intra-oral sinus tract\nTake 1 straight on periapical radiograph and 1 angled periapical radiograph. Resolution of apical radiolucency (often observed within 6-12months).\nRecord any increased width of root walls (this is generally observed before apparent increase in root length and often occurs 12-24 months after treatment)\nRecord any increase in root length (in mm)\nTest vitality of pulp with Endo-Ice and Electric pulp tester (EPT).\nRecord which goals have been attained (primary, secondary and/or tertiary)\n\nThe degree of success of RET is measured by the extent to which it is possible to attain primary, secondary and tertiary goals:\n\nPrimary goal: The elimination of symptoms and the evidence of bony healing\nSecondary goal: Increased root wall thickness and/or increased root length\nTertiary goal: Positive response to vitality testing"

          "National data indicate over 650,000 children and adolescents are exposed to physical, sexual, or emotional abuse or physical or emotional neglect each year. Moreover, youth with a history of childhood maltreatment (CM) are at least twice as likely to develop depression and are at substantial risk for nonresponse to current best practice depression interventions (i.e., cognitive behavioral therapy and antidepressants) compared to non-maltreated peers. Research suggests that CM increases risk for depression through disruptions in the positive valence system, such as reward processing, and Behavioral Activation (BA) may be an alternative depression intervention that targets these deficits. This study takes an innovative approach integrating neural, behavioral, and novel mobile technologies to measure longitudinal change in reward processing as a mechanism of BA intervention response among depressed adolescents with a history of CM. Specifically, depressed adolescents with a history of CM will complete pre- and post- BA intervention fMRI and behavioral measures of reward processing along with daily passive mobile monitoring of physical (steps) and social (amount of texts, calls, social media usage) activity to determine 1) how BA targets neural and behavioral reward processing and real-world behavioral engagement (Specific Aim 1), and 2) whether change in neural and behavioral reward processing predicts intervention response and maintenance (Specific Aim 2)."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Children with intellectual disabilities often display severe destructive behaviors that pose significant risk to self or others and represent barriers to community integration. These destructive behaviors are often treated with behavioral interventions derived from a functional analysis (FA), which is used to identify the environmental antecedents and consequences that occasion and reinforce (i.e., reward) the target response. One such treatment is called differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA), which involves extinction (i.e., removal of rewards) of destructive behavior and reinforcement of an alternative communication response with the consequence that previously reinforced destructive behavior. Results from review studies indicate that interventions based on an FA, like DRA, typically reduce problem behavior by 90% or more.\n\nOne commonly used DRA intervention is functional communication training (FCT). During FCT, clinicians withhold reinforcement for destructive behavior and teach the individual a functional communication response to access reinforcement. For instance, a clinician may teach the child to exchange communication cards to express their wants and needs. However, DRA interventions reported in the literature have typically been evaluated by experts in controlled research settings, and treatment relapse often occurs in the natural environment when a caregiver is unable reinforce the DRA response every time that the response occurs due to competing responsibilities. Accordingly, a recent investigation of 25 applications of DRA found that relapse of problem behavior occurred in 76% of cases.\n\nResurgence as Choice Theory helps to explain why treatment relapse occurs under these circumstances and also provides mathematical equations that can be used to predict the variables that increase and decrease the likelihood that treatment relapse will occur. In this project, the investigators have used these equations to identify refinements to DRA that are likely to decrease the probability that treatment relapse will occur when the DRA response is not reinforced. In some cases, these refinements are at odds with what is recommended in the clinical literature on DRA. Therefore, it is important to compare these refinements that are derived from Resurgence as Choice Theory with current clinical practice in order to determine the best way to implement DRA, so that treatment remains effective when it is implemented with less than perfect precision by caregivers in the natural environment.\n\nThe two predictions that are most relevant to our project are (a) resurgence of destructive behavior will decrease with increased DRA treatment duration, and (b) reinforcement schedule thinning show included slow, small decreases in reward deliveries (smaller than those previously reported in the literature). Accordingly, our project will examine the effects of different durations of DRA on resurgence and the effects of adjusting the schedule of reinforcement for each session to include slow and small decreases to avoid resurgence. Findings from this project could have vast clinical implications in that the investigators will demonstrate that time in treatment affects relapse and that schedule thinning can be accomplished without recurrence of destructive behavior. The investigators will compare short, moderate, and extended durations of treatment with DRA to identify the optimal duration of treatment to reduce the extent of relapse of destructive behavior. The investigators will demonstrate that the degree of relapse may depend on the length of treatment with DRA.\n\nThe investigators will use measurements of destructive behavior, appropriate behavior, and reinforcer deliveries during each treatment session to inform the number of reinforcers that will be available during upcoming treatment sessions, informed by both the Resurgence as Choice (RaC) Theory and on the results of a coordinated study with nonhuman animals. The investigators will demonstrate that this schedule thinning progression is efficacious at maintaining an 85% reduction in problem behavior (i.e., relative to baseline) during each treatment session."

It is hypothesized that the intervention will have positive effects on ethnic-racial identity development, stress biology (including sleep hours and quality and diurnal cortisol profiles), emotional well-being, executive functioning, and academic outcomes, particularly for minority youth."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "On average, students from disadvantaged racial-ethnic minority groups (such as Blacks and Hispanics) show lower academic performance and attainment on a variety of measures, including grades, test scores and graduation rates. Racial-ethnic minority students are also exposed to higher levels of stress, especially \"race-based stress,\" including higher levels of discrimination and stereotype threat. Past research has shown that race-based stress is related to alterations in stress biology, including altered stress hormone levels and less and lower quality sleep. Altered stress hormones and shorter and lower quality sleep in turn have important implications for multiple aspects of cognitive functioning, including executive functioning, that have known impacts on emotional well-being and academic performance.\n\nIt is therefore hypothesized that disparities in race-based stress and stress biology may help to account for racial-ethnic disparities in academic performance. One (correlational, non-causal) purpose of this study, therefore, is to measure and test associations among race-based social stress (RBSS, such as perceived racial discrimination), stress biology (cortisol daily rhythms and sleep hours and quality) and academic outcomes in 300 high school students in a racially diverse, mid-sized, suburban high school.\n\nAdditional research has shown that the presence of a strong ethnic-racial identity is associated with better-regulated stress biology and higher academic attainment. A second major purpose of this study, and the primary purpose of this RCT, is to test, through a random-assignment intervention, whether promoting positive ethnic and racial identity development serves to advance ethnic and racial identity development, improve stress biology, and improve emotional well-being, cognition (executive functioning), and academic outcomes. Positive effects on these outcomes are expected for those in the experimental (ethnic and racial identity promotion) group, compared to the comparison group. Effects are expected to be particularly strong for those in the experimental condition that are from black and hispanic ethnic and racial minority groups.\n\nThe present study will assess race-based social stress (received racial discrimination and stereotype threat susceptibility), ethnic and racial identity, cortisol, sleep, cognition (executive functioning), emotional and academic adjustment, and academic outcomes in a cohort of 300 high school freshman both before and after an 8-week randomized control trial of the Identity Project Intervention (Umaña-Taylor & Douglass, 2017; Umaña-Taylor, Douglass, Updegraff & Marsiglia, 2017). Participants will be recruited in 2 or (if necessary) 3 annual waves, with baseline data collection for the study starting on December 16, 2017. Initial tests of the RCT effects will occur immediately after the intervention and in the year subsequent to the intervention. Questionnaire and administrative outcomes will continue to be measured through the senior year of high school. Additional funding will be sought to measure physical health outcomes, and to follow participants into their college and/or work years. Study plans and hypotheses for these follow-on studies will be registered separately."

          "The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of the ambulatory monitoring protocol, called Pain Buddy, in documenting children's pain, symptoms and quality of life while receiving outpatient chemotherapy. The long term goal of Pain Buddy is to help doctors, nurses, and parents get the information they need to give children treatments for pain and symptom management that work. Using Pain Buddy, we aim to quantify the prevalence and intensity of daily pain and symptom episodes in children at home, data that will be used to develop a psychosocial intervention to be delivered electronically to children at home with a goal of improving quality of life. Secondary aims also include examining children's quality of life pre- and post- Pain Buddy and satisfaction with the use of Pain Buddy. This project has the potential to improve the quality of life of tens of thousands of children suffering from cancer each year using transformative mobile health information technology based approach to pain assessment and management."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Approximately 12,000 children are diagnosed with cancer in the United States each year and the majority of these children will experience moderate to severe pain and disabling symptoms such as fatigue and nausea during the course of their illness. Survivors of childhood cancer are also at high-risk for long-term chronic pain. Unfortunately, the World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that current efforts to manage pain in pediatric oncology patients are seriously inadequate. Reasons for under treatment of pain and symptoms in children diagnosed with cancer are complex and are likely related to deficits in the process of assessment and management as well as lack of timely access to pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Management of pain in this population is also compounded by the fact that increasing numbers of children currently receive chemotherapy on an outpatient basis due to advances in healthcare and changes in the medical-economical environment.\n\nTo date, interventions targeting pain and symptom management in the home setting of children suffering from cancer are seriously lacking. To address this significant gap, the candidate is proposing significant training in pediatric cancer pain and symptom management and an innovative two-phase research strategy. The first phase of research will focus on the development and formative evaluation of an innovative handheld electronic program (Pain Buddy) that provides remote monitoring of pain and symptoms and delivery of cognitive and behavioral skills training to children undergoing treatment for cancer. The second phase of this application involves evaluation of the efficacy of the program using a randomized controlled trial design. Pain Buddy will allow for collection of \"real time\" pain and symptom data that will be transmitted immediately and monitored remotely by the oncology treatment team. Remote symptom monitoring in real time will provide an opportunity for timely implementation of appropriate interventions, thereby introducing the potential to decrease pain and symptoms and improve quality of life. Pain Buddy will also deliver psychosocial skills training, teaching cognitive and behavioral strategies to manage pain and symptom-related distress. The skills training will target coping and self-efficacy in children without the need for face-to-face intervention which is not feasible in the majority of settings. Symptom monitoring and skills training will further increase patient engagement in their own health care, which is a main goal of the Institute of Medicine and many other organizations. The objectives outlined above will be accomplished by the following specific aims:\n\nPHASE I: Development and Formative Evaluation Specific Aim 1: Through collaboration with the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2), develop and examine the usability of a cognitive and behavioral skills training intervention (Pain Buddy) delivered via electronic, handheld technology in conjunction with a validated pain and symptom assessment protocol (Jacob, E.) that will allow for monitoring of and response to pain and symptoms of pediatric oncology patients in real time.\n\nHypothesis 1. Children and their parents will demonstrate the ability to use Pain Buddy on the electronic device and will rate high levels of acceptability, usability and satisfaction on beta testing.\n\nPHASE II: Randomized Controlled Trial of Pain Buddy Specific Aim 2: Using a randomized controlled trial design, we will examine the efficacy of Pain Buddy in managing pain and symptoms in children suffering from cancer.\n\nHypothesis 2. Children enrolled in the Pain Buddy group will report lower symptom-related distress as measured by the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS), compared to children in the monitoring group (primary outcome).\n\nHypothesis 3. Children in the Pain Buddy group will evidence lower pain severity and higher quality of life compared with children in the monitoring group (secondary outcomes).\n\nHypothesis 4. Children and nurses will demonstrate high rates of compliance (85% or greater) with Pain Buddy (secondary outcome).\n\nThe long-term goals of this research are to develop a usable, engaging electronic decision-support pain and symptom management intervention for children receiving outpatient chemotherapy using Smartphone technology and to examine the efficacy of the electronic decision-support intervention on children's pain and quality of life. These long-term goals will be accomplished through assessment of the data collected from patients, parents and physicians using the ambulatory monitoring protocol.\n\nPHASE III: Multi-Site Randomized Controlled Trial of Pain Buddy\n\nPrimary Aim: Determine if Pain Buddy is more effective than attention control in reducing pain severity among children ages 8-18 years old undergoing outpatient cancer treatment.\n\nSecondary Aims:\n\nExamine the impact of Pain Buddy on symptom-related distress, health-related quality of life, functional status, and satisfaction with treatment experience.\nDetermine whether baseline characteristics of children (emotional functioning) and parents (stress, attitudes regarding analgesic use for children) moderate the effect of Pain Buddy on pain severity."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "When injected into the body, gadolinium contrast medium makes certain tissues, abnormalities or disease processes more clearly visible on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and therefore gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in medical imaging. Recently, new evidence suggests that following GBCA administration, gadolinium can be deposited in body tissues even in the presence of normal renal function. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that significant accumulation of free Gd3+ is not occurring in the bones of children undergoing clinical contrasted MRI scans. This is particularly important for those pediatric patients who will undergo multiple repeated MRI exams throughout their lifetime and thereby be exposed to a large cumulative dose of gadolinium contrast. As the differences in stability between the various GBCAs may be a factor in gadolinium exposure, the primary objective of this study is to assess gadolinium deposition in the bones of pediatric patients in two patient groups: 1. patients who received IV administration of gadolinium contrast agent (Dotarem) and 2. patients who received IV administration of gadolinium contrast agent (MultiHance).\n\nOnce acquired the samples will be analyzed at an off-site facility, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), using standardized equipment which has been certified for measuring gadolinium concentration in contrast agent samples. A signed agreement for the transfer of non-proprietary biological material between MUSC and NIST covers the transfer of the samples."

        "BriefSummary": [
          "During adolescence, the most common causes of morbidity and mortality are related to risky behaviors. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that adolescents be screened for these behaviors during primary care visits, but many adolescents do not receive the recommended risk behavior screening and counseling, in part because they are infrequently seen in primary care. The objective of this study is to evaluate if the electronic health screening tool, which includes an electronic health assessment with integrated personalized feedback, reduces risk behaviors in adolescents seen in the Emergency Department (ED)."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Adolescents and their parents (if participant is under the age of 18 years) will be approached and invited to participate in the study during their Emergency Department (ED) visit. Following consent, adolescents will be randomized to the intervention or control group. A tablet computer will be provided to the participants for use during their baseline assessment in the ED. The CheckED Yourself App will be pre-loaded on the tablet. The CheckED Yourself App (eHA-IPF) is an innovative electronic health screening tool with integrated personalized feedback about risk behaviors. The CheckED Yourself App (eHA-IPF) will be divided into an assessment about risk behaviors and a personalized feedback portion. Participants will be randomized to a control or intervention group at the time of consent. Those in the intervention group will receive both parts of the CheckED Yourself App, while the control group will receive only the assessment with no feedback.\n\nThose in the Intervention arm will complete the health risk behavior assessment and receive integrated personalized feedback from the CheckED Yourself App (eHA-IPF), and those in the control group will complete the health risk behavior assessment only. Participants will complete the questionnaire at some point during their ED visit and prior to discharge.\n\nFollow-up assessments will be completed at 1-day and 3 months post ED visit via an online survey. Reminders for the 1-day and 3-month follow-ups will be sent via email or text message. The 1-day assessment will focus on adolescent-reported motivation to make a health behavior change, the content of the ED visit including what, if any, risk behaviors their ED provider discussed with the participant, and satisfaction with care in the ED. The 3-month assessment will include a re-assessment of risk behaviors."

          "When a child comes in to the Emergency Room with a skin cut, if the child and their parents consent to being in the study, they will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: stitches, skin glue, or medical tape. There will be about 30 kids in each group, and thus 90 kids total in the study.\n\nIn the Emergency Room, a lidocaine ointment will be placed on the child's cut to decrease pain. The cut will be cleaned out with sterile saline. Then, depending on which method is used, the cut will be closed with either stitches, skin glue, or medical tape by their doctor. The participants will be asked to answer a short questionnaire. Finally, they will be given discharge instructions and sent home. At 3 months, the investigators will call parents for a quick questionnaire over the phone and parents will be asked to take a picture of the patient's scar and send it to the study staff.\n\nOnce all 90 pictures have been collected, two Plastic Surgeons will be asked to rate the scars in terms of how they look. The Plastic Surgeons will not know which method was used to close which cut. Once all of the scars have been rated, the averages of scars will be compared for each closure method. The investigators will also look at how much each method cost, how much extra pain medications or sedation each group used, and which method was liked best."

          "This study is a Phase II controlled clinical trial that will obtain comprehensive, serial assessments of respiratory muscle strength and architecture to understand the evolution of ventilator-induced respiratory muscle weakness in critically ill children, and test whether a novel computer-based approach (Real-time Effort Driven ventilator management (REDvent)) can preserve respiratory muscle strength and reduce time on MV. REDvent offers systematic recommendations to reduce controlled ventilation during the acute phase of MV, and uses real-time measures from esophageal manometry to adjust supported ventilator pressures such that patient effort of breathing remains in a normal range during the ventilator weaning phase. This phase II clinical trial is expected to enroll 276 children with pulmonary parenchymal disease, anticipated to be ventilated > 48 hrs. Patients will be randomized to REDvent-acute vs. usual care for the acute phase of MV (interval from intubation to first spontaneous breathing trial (SBT)). Patients in either group who fail their first Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT), will also be randomized to REDvent-weaning vs. usual care for the weaning phase of MV (interval from first SBT to passing SBT). The primary clinical outcome is length of weaning (time from first SBT until successful passage of an SBT or extubation (whichever comes first)). Mechanistic outcomes surround multi-modal serial measures of respiratory muscle capacity (PiMax), load (resistance, compliance), effort (esophageal manometry), and architecture (ultrasound) throughout the course of MV. Upon completion, this study will provide important information on the pathogenesis and timing of respiratory muscle weakness during MV in children and whether this weakness can be mitigated by promoting more normal patient effort during MV via the use of REDvent. This will form the basis for a larger, Phase III multi-center study, powered for key clinical outcomes such as 28-day Ventilator Free Days."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Study Aims:\n\nSA1: To determine if REDvent acute and/or weaning phase protocols can shorten the duration of weaning from MV (Primary outcome).\n\nSA2: To determine if changes to direct measures of respiratory muscle strength, load, effort, and architecture throughout the duration of MV are related to weaning outcomes.\n\nSA3: To determine if patient effort of breathing during both acute and weaning phases of MV is independently associated with the development of respiratory muscle weakness.\n\nStudy Design: Single-center randomized controlled trial (138 children per arm) using REDvent (intervention arm) as compared with usual care ventilator management including a standardized daily SBT (control arm). Acute phase randomization will occur upon study enrollment, and patients who fail the first SBT will undergo a weaning phase randomization. The investigators will obtain serial measurements of respiratory system capacity, load, effort of breathing, and diaphragm architecture throughout the course of MV.\n\nAcute Phase: The acute phase is defined as the time from intubation until the patient meets weaning criteria, passes the initial oxygenation test (decrease PEEP to 5 cmH2O and FiO2 to 0.5, maintains SpO2 > 90%), and undergoes a Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT).\n\nIntervention Arm (REDvent-acute): Patients will be managed with pressure control plus pressure support ventilation using a computerized decision support tool that will recommend changes to ventilator settings approximately every 4 hr (with or without a new blood gas). If the patient is spontaneously breathing, it will incorporate real-time measures of effort of breathing (esophageal manometry) to keep it in a target range.\nControl Arm (Control-acute): Ventilator management will be per usual care until the patient meets weaning criteria and passes the oxygenation test.\n\nWeaning Phase: The weaning phase is defined as the time from the first Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT) until the patient successfully passes an SBT or is extubated (whichever comes first). Patients who pass the initial SBT at the end of the acute phase will not undergo weaning phase randomization.\n\nIntervention Arm (REDvent-weaning): Patients will be managed in a pressure support/CPAP mode of ventilation with assessments or changes to the level of pressure support every 4 hours, targeting maintaining effort of breathing (esophageal manometry) in a normal range. An SBT will be conducted daily, and the weaning phase will continue until the patient passes the SBT.\nControl Arm (Control-weaning): Ventilator management will be per usual care. An SBT will be conducted daily, and the weaning phase will continue until the patient passes the SBT.\n\nAnalysis Plan and Sample Size Justification:\n\nAim 1: The primary outcome is weaning duration. Sample size has been determined to adequately power 3 separate comparative analyses: (a) REDvent-acute versus Acute Phase control (b) REDvent-weaning phase versus Weaning Phase control (c) REDvent both phases versus control both phases. Power is based on 2 planned methods for analysis: cox proportional hazard ratios for multivariable analysis and univariate analysis with an independent t-test using log transformation (as needed) to account for the expected distribution of weaning duration. For all three of the planned comparisons above, with the proposed sample size the investigators would be adequately powered (>0.8) to detect a difference in weaning duration of ≥ 1 day, or a hazard ratio of ≥ 1.4 between groups. The secondary outcomes are ventilator free days and extubation failure. Directly comparing control only patients to REDvent only patients, with an expected standard deviation for VFDs between 5 to 9 days, the investigators will be able to detect a 2-day change in VFDs between groups with a power between 0.35 and 0.82. Re-intubation rates are expected to be 10%, allowing the investigators to confirm that REDvent is not inferior to usual care in regards to re-intubation with a non-inferiority margin of 0.10 with a power of 0.8 and alpha of 0.05.\n\nAim 2: The primary outcome of this aim is weaning duration. For respiratory muscle strength the investigators will compare the first measured aPiMax (after resolution of the acute phase, before the first SBT), the trajectory and value of the daily aPiMax during the weaning phase prior to extubation, the lowest and highest measured aPiMax, and aPiMax on the day of extubation against weaning duration. For analysis, aPiMax will be dichotomized at 30 cmH2O, and weaning duration will be compared between patients with aPiMax > 30 versus ≤ 30 cmH2O using a t-test with or without log-transformation, or Mann-Whitney U test, depending on the distribution. From preliminary data, it is anticipated at least 35% of patients (n=84) will have aPiMax ≤ 30 cmH2O. Based on a similar power analysis as presented above, this would allow the investigators to determine whether low aPiMax is associated with a ≥ 1-day increase in weaning duration, with an alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.8. The investigators will perform identical analysis for ePiMax. Diaphragm Thickness analysis will compound daily ultrasound measures to detect the relative change in diaphragm thickness from study day 1 until passage of an SBT. The investigators will compare the change in thickness after resolution of the acute phase (on the day of the first SBT) against weaning duration, in a similar manner as proposed above for aPiMax. In addition to weaning duration, the investigators will also examine whether the respiratory measures taken just prior to or during each SBT are associated with the patient passing the SBT. For example with aPiMax and ePiMax, the investigators will examine if there is a dose response relationship between PiMax measured just before the SBT and the rate of passage of the subsequent SBT.\n\nAim 3: The primary outcome of this aim is aPiMax < 30 cmH2O.The analysis will focus on determining whether the degree of patient effort of breathing is independently associated with the development of respiratory muscle weakness. For the acute phase, the investigators will generate a time-weighted average PRP during the acute phase and graph it against aPiMax at the first SBT. They will subsequently dichotomize aPiMax at the first SBT and compare mean time weighted average PRP in the acute phase between aPiMax groups (> 30 vs. ≤ 30 cmH2O). For the weaning phase, the investigators will graph the changes in aPiMax throughout the weaning phase (from first failed SBT until successful SBT) against time-weighted average PRP, with the anticipation that low PRP will be associated with either further reductions in aPiMax, or no improvement, while PRP in the physiologic range of 150-400 will be associated with improvement in aPiMax. The investigators will subsequently dichotomize aPiMax (at 30 cm H2O) at the time of successful passage of an SBT and compare time-weighted average PRP in the weaning phase between aPiMax groups. Subsequently, the investigators will build a multivariable logistic regression model on the outcome of aPiMax ≤ 30 cmH2O to determine if time-weighted PRP in the acute phase, weaning phase or both have an independent association with preserving aPiMax, after controlling for confounding variables."

          "This study is a randomized clinical trial designed to compare an online social intelligence intervention with an active control condition at improving the emotional, physical, and social well-being of custodial grandmothers and their adolescent grandchildren,"
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "The investigators examine the efficacy of an online Social Intelligence Intervention (SII) at improving the health and well-being of custodial grandmothers (CGMs) and their adolescent custodial grandchildren (ACG) through mutual enhancement of their social competencies. This target population is of particular importance because both CGMs and ACG experience significant early life adversities that lead to hypervigilance of others, mistrust, social isolation, interpersonal conflict, and the inability to garner warmth and support from family and friends. Numerous studies have shown that these relational challenges within \"risky families\" often lead to life-long interpersonal difficulties that increase the probability of behavioral and physical health problems. Furthermore, adolescence is a key period for the development of social competence, which is influenced by supportive caregiving and positive modeling from female parent figures. However, because the ability of CGMs to carry out this intergenerational transmission of social skills is challenged, examining joint social intelligence training for CGM-ACG dyads is valuable for reversing this negative sequela. Yet, to date, no other investigators have done so. To address this gap, ant an online randomized clinical trial will be conducted with 340 nationally-recruited CGM-ACG (ages 12-18) dyads assigned to either the SII or an attention control condition. Data will be obtained at pre- and post-test, and at 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-ups via questionnaires completed by phone. Daily dairies will be collected online from 170 randomly selected dyads, and qualitative interviews will be conducted with 60 dyads to probe how the SII affected their daily social competence and social ties. We will obtain quantitative and qualitative measures of key social cognitive processes, quality of close interpersonal ties, psychological well-being, and physical health. Administrative medical, criminal, and education records for all 340 dyads will also be obtained for cost-benefit analyses that examine changes in burden on public systems. These mixed-methods allow rigorous examination of four specific aims: (1) To investigate if the SII enhances social competencies that, in turn, produce long-term changes in relationship quality, well-being, and physical health; this includes determining if increased social competence in one dyad member leads to partner effects in the other; (2) To examine if cumulative risk, gender, and age moderate SII efficacy; (3) To study qualitatively how CGM-ACG dyads view the SII as having changed their social competencies and yielded positive outcomes; and (4) To assess the financial benefits of the SII to participants and their communities. These aims address a highly significant public health problem that will inform future efforts to support a wide range of high risk families, like custodial grandfamilies, who typically have insufficient access to formal support services. This SII is advantageous because it is inexpensive, delivered online, non-stigmatizing, and capable of reaching a target population that is geographically disperse and greatly in need of supportive programming."

          "Survivors of childhood cancer often suffer treatment-related toxicities, including chronic health conditions, high symptom burden and emotional distress, and decremented functional status and quality of life. Although some patient-reported outcome (PRO) tools are available for survivors of childhood cancer younger than 18 years old, very few studies have been designed to evaluate longitudinal measurement properties of these PRO tools. In this study the investigators propose to recruit participants from a cohort of diverse childhood cancer survivors who were treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (St. Jude) to improve assessment tools for PROs and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).\n\nThe purpose of this study is to measure the link between Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and clinical assessments of childhood cancer survivors over time. PROMIS is a questionnaire that measures patient-reported outcomes in adults and children.\n\nThe study plans to enroll 300 children. Surveys will be completed by the children and their parents/legal guardians (a total of 600 surveys).\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nTo evaluate the longitudinal construct validity of the PROMIS Pediatric measures for childhood cancer survivors by testing the association of change in PROMIS PRO scores and the change in health status measured by objective clinical assessment. Age at baseline and sex will be included in the analysis.\nTo establish clinically meaningful classifications of the PROMIS Pediatric measures for childhood cancer survivors by referring PROMIS PRO scores to health status measured by clinical assessment. Age at baseline and sex will be included in the analysis.\nTo estimate the minimally important differences (MIDs) of the PROMIS Pediatric measures by referring to the change of health status evaluated by anchor-based anchors and patient-based anchors for childhood cancer survivors. Age at baseline and sex will be included in the analysis."

          "A longitudinal framework was designed to collect data from childhood cancer survivors (8-18.9 years of age) and parents of participating cancer survivors (i.e., dyads) when they visit the After Completion of Therapy (ACT) clinic at St. Jude in three consecutive years (approximately 1 year apart; T1, T2, and T3).\n\nParticipants will complete pediatric patient-reported outcomes (PRO) survey/questionnaires, a neurocognitive assessment and physical performance evaluation will be completed, and parental surveys will be conducted. In addition, any data collected as part of the SJLIFE protocol may also be used as part of this study.\n\nThe Pediatric PRO survey/questionnaires collection information on PROs. They include questions about general health, pain interference, fatigue, psychological stress experiences, stigma, sleep disturbance, sleep-related impairment, positive affect, meaning and purpose, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and physical function-mobility. Each cancer survivor will complete these during annual follow-up visits at three time points: years 1, 2 and 3. This process takes approximately 30-40 minutes.\nNeurocognitive evaluation is done by tests given by a licensed or certified psychological examiner to evaluate how the participant processes information. The tests evaluate how problems are solved, how well information is remembered, how well the participant pays attention, how quickly they understand information, and their assessment of quality of life. The tests are commonly used standardized tests that take about 2 hours to complete.\nPhysical performance evaluation will measure heart and lung fitness, flexibility, mobility, muscle strength, endurance, balance and physical mobility. Testing takes about 2 hours to complete and includes six-minute walk test, walking speed test, muscle strength and flexibility, and balance.\nThe parental survey is a parent-report form (PRF) to be completed by parents/legal guardians of participants. Information collected on the PRF includes demographic information, parental quality of life, social support, family dynamics, parenting behaviors, and the child's health care utilization data. The child and parent data will be compared. Parental questionnaires will be completed at one time point, year 1, 2, or 3, and will take approximately 40 minutes to complete."

          "This study will utilize a prospective randomized cohort of adolescent patients that present to the orthopedic sports center (age restriction greater than 12 years old) with adolescent anterior knee pain. This knee pain includes: Osgood-Schlatter disease, Sindig-Larsen-Johanssen syndrome, patellofemoral syndrome, symptomatic medial plicae, and Hoffa fat pad syndrome/impingement. Although these diagnoses affect slightly different sites at the anterior knee, the underlying pathology is essentially the same: muscle inflexibility and core strength weakness. These are clinical diagnoses, and plain radiographs are expected to be normal with no significant osseous abnormalities other than possible apophyseal fragmentation. Skeletal maturity will not be an exclusion criteria; but, previous surgery, history of hemarthrosis, previous physical therapy due to lack of control within the cohorts, and/or diagnosis of ligament, meniscal, cartilage, or tendon injury will be criteria for exclusion.\n\nRandomization by computer generated order of consent packets will be utilized once the family and patient agrees to undergo treatment via the proposed trial. Two cohorts of patients will be created: Cohort #1 and #2. Cohort #1 will consist of patients that begin with the PT portion of the study (2 sessions per week for 6 weeks per standard of care) and cross-over in the ARP Wave protocol (20 sessions over 4 weeks). Cohort #2 will consist of patients that begin with the ARP Wave protocol and then cross-over in the standard PT protocol.\n\nBoth cohorts will undergo physical therapy utilizing a standard of care uniform PT protocol for a traumatic knee pain that focuses on flexibility and development of hip core strength over a 6 week period, visiting the therapist twice per week and encouraged to maintain a home exercise program (HEP). They will all receive a handout with basic exercises to use at home to ensure that progress with their HEP is maximized (Appendix I). Basic stretches for the hamstring and quadriceps muscles will also be provided with line drawings. During this treatment period the patients will complete a daily diary of time spent on the HEP with attestation from their parents or guardians, in order to improve compliance.\n\nBoth cohorts will undergo the same ARP Wave protocol, as well. There are 20 sessions that are used to take a single individual through to completion of treatment over a period of 30 days. During that time frame the athletes are not allowed to undergo PT, HEP or their normal athletic endeavors since it may interfere with the neuromuscular training particular to this therapeutic modality. Treatments will be performed at an outside vendor that has agreed to perform the treatments at reduced cost for the sake of this study.\n\nBoth cohorts of patients will be evaluated every two weeks, for 10 weeks, by an independent team of observers who will be blinded to the actual cohort that the patient is randomized. These individuals will perform a Return to Sports (RTS) assessment and measurement of thigh circumference of the patients at these biweekly assessments. Although the RTS will not provide an objective measure of absolute core muscle strength, it does provide an objective measure of dynamic muscle function - which is the ultimate objective of these treatment modalities, not absolute strength of any given muscle such as the quadriceps. Moreover, the RTS makes an objective assessment of both strength and endurance of the core lower extremity muscle groups. These independent observers will also administer patient-derived outcome scores.\n\nAn interim analysis for each patient will be performed once they complete their first arm of the study. Both the research staff and the orthopedic surgeon principal investigator (PI) will examine the outcome variables at this time in insure safety in treatment. If the patients are scoring in the 95% percentile on all outcome measures, they will be considered as reaching the study endpoint and will not cross-over into the next phase of treatment. For patients who do not reach this 95% percentile of healing at the end of the first arm, crossover into the next arm of the study will occur immediately. At the end of 10 weeks and successful completion of both arms of the study, the patient will be seen by the orthopedic surgeon to make a final assessment regarding treatment progress, knee pain, and whether or not further treatment will be required (in the standard of care for these patients, regardless of study cohort)."

          "There is a clear unmet need for new therapeutics to treat irritability in children with ASD that do not have the metabolic and weight adverse event profiles of the currently approved treatments. Cannabidivarin (CBDV) is a nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid and a safe variant of Cannabidiol (CBD). It has no appreciable tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) [less than 0.01%], has been shown to have no impact on weight or metabolism, and improves both social and cognitive functioning in animal models of idiopathic and syndromal autism (Fragile X, Rett Syndrome, Angelman Syndrome). The CDC currently estimates 1 in 59 children have ASD. ASD is characterized by deficits in social communication, irritability, repetitive behaviors, impulsivity, temper tantrums, and high caregiver burden. Currently, the only FDA-approved medications for symptoms of ASD are aripiprazole and risperidone, both of which are indicated for irritability in pediatric ASD. These medications are effective but are associated with considerable side effects with long term treatment in this chronic developmental disorder, including weight gain, metabolic syndrome and the risk of type 2 diabetes, prolactin elevation and growth of breast tissue, extrapyramidal symptoms and the risk of tardive dyskinesia. The anticonvulsant divalproex sodium (valproate/VPA) also significantly reduces irritability and repetitive behaviors in individuals with ASD. Although VPA is efficacious for pediatric epilepsy and some symptoms of ASD, it also has significant side effects, including weight gain, sedation and nausea. CBDV, like VPA, is effective in the treatment of pediatric epilepsy, and ASD mouse models demonstrate potential mechanisms for treatment with CBDV, including potential therapeutic effects on repetitive behaviors, irritability, sociability, and quality of life, and the capacity to reduce inflammation. This study aims to examine the efficacy and safety of cannabidivarin (CBDV) with a primary aim of studying its effect on irritability in children with ASD.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN: This is a 12-week randomized, double-blind study of CBDV vs. placebo in 100 child and adolescent subjects aged 5 to 18 years with a diagnosis of ASD."

        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Adolescents (ages 13 to 18) with TTH will be randomly assigned to either a Hatha yoga intervention (n = 20) or a wait-list control condition (n = 20). The yoga intervention will consist of 8 weekly classes lasting one hour each taught by an experienced yoga teacher. Each class will have a maximum of 10 participants. A baseline assessment including an experimental pain protocol, questionnaires, and hair samples (to determine cortisol concentrations in the past month) will be completed prior to the intervention. Biweekly questionnaires will be completed by both intervention and wait-list groups during the 8-week intervention period. The post-intervention assessment will include the experimental pain protocol, questionnaires, and hair samples (to determine cortisol concentrations in the past month). The wait-list control group will subsequently receive the yoga intervention and complete post-intervention and follow-up assessments (i.e., the wait-list group will complete one more experimental pain protocol and will provide one more hair sample than the intervention group); these data will then be merged with that of the yoga group to examine pre- and post-intervention effects. Both intervention and wait-list groups will complete questionnaires 3 months following completion of the yoga protocol.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To determine the safety, feasibility, and acceptability of an 8-week Hatha Yoga Protocol (HYP) in adolescents (ages 13 to 18) with tension-type headache (CTTH). Hypothesis: At least 80% of adolescents will complete the HYP. Attrition rates will be compared between HYP and control groups to determine whether results may be biased given different durations of the study protocols between the two groups and interval between recruitment and intervention (i.e., control group will be in the protocol for two additional months and the intervention will be delayed by 8 weeks).\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To evaluate changes in primary outcomes (frequency and intensity of headaches, pain-related functional disability, health-related quality of life, medication use) from baseline to post-intervention in the HYP and usual care wait-list controls. Hypothesis: Participants in the HYP group will demonstrate greater reduction in headache frequency and intensity, decreases in pain-related functional disability, improvement in health-related quality of life, and reduction in medication use compared to wait-list controls from baseline to post-intervention. Secondary analyses will examine changes from pre- to post-intervention for the entire sample once the waitlist group has completed the HYP; in addition, sustained intervention effects will be determined by examining changes from post-intervention to 3-month follow-up for the entire sample.\n\nSpecific Aim 3: To assess changes in potential mediators of clinical outcomes following the HYP, including responses to experimental pain [conditioned pain modulation (CPM), temporal summation to second pain (TSSP)], alterations in stress response systems [hair cortisol concentrations, self-reported stress levels, stress hormone responses to experimental pain (cortisol, alpha-amylase, DHEA), heart rate variability responses to experimental pain] and pain-related cognitions (catastrophizing, self-efficacy, acceptance). Hypothesis: Participants in the HYP group will show increased CPM, decreased TSSP, reduced hair cortisol concentrations and self-reported stress levels, lower cortisol and alpha-amylase responses to experimental pain, higher DHEA responses to experimental pain, lower heart rate variability prior to experimental pain, reduced pain catastrophizing, increased pain self-efficacy, and increased pain acceptance compared to wait-list controls at post-intervention.\n\nAlthough yoga has shown promise as a complementary health approach for chronic pain in adults, few studies have examined the potential efficacy of yoga for adolescents with chronic pain. Anticipated findings from the proposed study will help to determine whether - and how - an 8-week yoga intervention can improve pain-related outcomes in adolescents with TTH; these findings will be critical for refinement of the HYP for youth with TTH and for the design and implementation of a larger-scale, randomized controlled trial with an active control condition.\n\nBackground and Significance\n\nTTH is common in youth and associated with significant functional disability. Complementary health approaches such as Hatha yoga, which emphasize physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation, have been shown to reduce chronic pain-related disability. The only known pilot study of yoga for youth with headache showed moderate but non-significant improvement in daily functioning from baseline to post-intervention (Hainsworth et al., 2014). A randomized controlled trial of yoga for headache pain in adults found that the yoga group exhibited reduced migraine frequency and intensity, lower pain severity, and less medication use for headache compared to the control group after 12 weeks. Potential mechanisms underlying improvements in pain outcomes following yoga interventions include physiological, behavioral and psychological changes. Adults with TTH are characterized by impaired CPM and enhanced TSSP. Moreover, increased pain sensitivity in adults with TTH appears to be exacerbated by chronic stress, sustained physiological arousal, and negative cognitions. The proposed study addresses a critical gap in the literature by investigating the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of Hatha yoga as a complementary treatment approach for youth with TTH.\n\nPreliminary Studies\n\nMembers of this research team have previously employed a similar experimental pain protocol to demonstrate elevated TSSP in female adolescents with functional abdominal pain, elevated TSSP in adolescents with both functional abdominal pain and a history of physical or sexual assault/abuse, and racial differences in both TSSP and CPM in healthy youth ages 10 to 17.\n\nSample Size Justification and Statistical Analysis Plan\n\nSample size estimation: Prior yoga interventions in youth with chronic pain suggest medium-to-large effect sizes (Cohen's d comparing mean changes from baseline to post-intervention) for indices of changes in pain-related functional disability. For power calculations, G*Power 3.1.9.2 was used to estimate the sample size required for estimated effect sizes ranging from .50 to .80. Assuming a Type I error rate of α = .05 and statistical power of 0.80, results indicated a range from 16 to 34 total participants. Assuming a 20% attrition rate and adopting the more conservative anticipated total n = 34, the investigators estimate that 40 total subjects will need to be recruited (20 per group).\n\nData analytic strategy: Group differences in primary outcomes (Specific Aim 2) will be tested using analysis of covariance, controlling for baseline scores on these outcome variables. An intent-to-treat analysis of primary outcome measures (including all enrolled participants and utilizing the last observation carry forward approach) will be conducted to confirm findings in participants who complete the HYP.\n\nA series of linear regressions will test the direct effects of the intervention on outcome variables and the indirect effects of mediators on the relationship between mediator and outcome (Specific Aim 3). Mediation analyses will be run using the Preacher and Hayes (2008) SPSS Macro for Multiple Mediation. In order for statistical mediation to occur, two criteria are necessary: 1) there is an effect to be mediated (i.e., a significant association between intervention and the outcome), and 2) the indirect effect of intervention on outcome via mediator was significant. The indirect effect will be considered significant at the p < .05 level if the corresponding bootstrapped confidence interval does not contain zero. Bootstrapping procedures will test each mediation model by generating a 95% confidence interval (bias corrected) around the indirect effect test statistic in a series of 1000 Bootstrap samples repeatedly drawn from the full sample.\n\nPotential limitations. The pilot study sample size is modest but will yield critical data regarding effect sizes for primary pain-related outcome variables as well as potential mediators of treatment effects."

        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Atomoxetine (ATX), Strattera®, is a norepinephrine re-uptake transporter inhibitor that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The drug is often considered a second- or third-line agent, due to the perception that the drug does not work very well. In fact, in a review of studies submitted to the FDA, it reported that there appeared to be discrete classes of response to atomoxetine. After 6-9 weeks of treatment, 47% of the patients were considered \"responders\" based on changes in the rating scales used to measure ADHD symptoms whereas 40% of patients were considered non-responders. Statistically significant (p<0.001) differences in scores between responders and non-responders were apparent after the first week of treatment. At the relatively low starting doses of the titration scheme, this suggests that there may be a subgroup of patents who are particularly responsive to ATX. We hypothesize that there could be two reasons for this: 1) variability in drug pharmacokinetics (i.e., inadequate drug concentrations in the blood over time could lead to poor response) and 2) variability in drug pharmacodynamics (i.e. differences at the level of the target of drug action that limit the response to a drug, regardless of concentration of drug present in the blood). The CYP2D6 gene, which encodes for the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6, is responsible for the clearance of ATX from the body, is highly polymorphic. ATX metabolism by CYP2D6 protein is one of the major routes of clearance (i.e., removal) of this drug. Genetic variability in the CYP2D6 gene leads to wide inter-individual variability in the activity of the enzyme, ultimately resulting in differing amount of drug in the body (also referred to as \"exposure,\" and is a component of drug pharmacokinetics). Secondly, the SLC6A2 gene which encodes for the norepinephrine reuptake transporter, the drug target for ATX, is also subject to genetic variation. Reported genetic variants of SLC6A2 have been associated with decreased abundance of the transporter. The consequences of SLC6A2 genetic variation with regards to ATX clinical response are currently unknown. In the context of distinct \"responder\" and \"non-responder\" groups with a population of atomoxetine-treated patients, non-response could be due to definable differences at the level of the drug target (patients unlikely to respond regardless of the ATX concentrations achieved), or simply a consequence of inadequate exposure in a substantial proportion of population. The goal of this study is to address this issue."

          "Health-related quality of life is an important outcome of cancer treatment which encompasses physical, psychological, social, and functional well-being. In addition, quality of life includes one's overall ability to become a productive member of society and achieve personal fulfillment. Treatment of pediatric cancer is a highly stressful experience which can be challenging and disruptive to the lives of children and their families. Pediatric oncology patients receiving chemotherapy often experience a decline in quality of life due to decreased activity, fatigue, and psychological distress such as depression or anxiety when compared to healthy individuals. Preliminary data suggests that there is an association between physical activity and quality of life. Exercise has been show to improve mood, increase energy levels, and reduce stress. Although more research and clinical resources have been given to the effects of exercise on quality of life among adult cancer patients, there is a lack of research in these areas among children with cancer. The investigators know little about whether children with cancer would benefit from exercise.\n\nThe investigators have added a blood sample for biomarkers. Research in adult cancer patients have shown an association between different biomarkers and sleep quality which suggests that regulation of certain biomarkers may be affected through exercise in adults. Measures of biomarkers may provide insight into potential mediators between PA, sleep quality, or fatigue levels."

          "Screening visit: There will be one screening visit before the study. We will do some blood tests that will determine if the subjects can be in this study. If the subject is qualify, he/she will be asked to return for the following scheduled visits.\n\nStudy visit 1: We will draw a small amount of subject's blood from the IV. The study subject's blood will then be marked with biotin. We will give back the subject's blood marked with biotin through IV within 4 to 6 hours. Endotoxin analysis (conducted pre-infusion) and bacterial culture analysis (conducted post-infusion) will be performed. Twenty minutes after the blood transfusion, we will draw blood from the IV. After that, we will take out the IV and the subject can go home.\n\nAll follow-up study visits:\n\nThe subject will have a study visit 24 hours after receiving blood marked with biotin. After that, the subject will have a clinic visit every 7-10 days. These visits will end when we can no longer find the biotin marked blood cells in the subject's blood. This is expected to be approximately 12 weeks later.\n\nAt these visits, we will draw blood and also collect all blood glucose results in the past 7-10 days.\n\nAfter the study visits are completed, there will be one follow-up visit 4-6 months after the subject receives the biotin marked RBCs. We will draw about 0.25 ml of blood.\n\nContinuous glucose monitoring and HbA1c determination-- We will monitor continuous glucose concentrations throughout the study. This will be accomplished by setting up FreeStyle Libre Pro continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device for each study subject. In addition, HbA1c will be measured once in the middle of the study (likely visit 6) and in the end of the study (likely visit 12)."

        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is an inflammatory condition of the lungs that leads to obstructive physiology, irreversible fibrosis of terminal bronchioles, and obliteration of the small airways. In both children and adults, the prevalence of BOS is approximately 6% in those with chronic graft-vs-host disease (cGVHD), although this may be a gross underestimation given current diagnostic guidelines. Once diagnosed, the prognosis is extremely unfavorable. BOS carries a mortality rate of approximately 40-60%, with a five year survival rate of 13%.\n\nEarly on, BOS is symptomatically silent. Once symptoms are present, there is a high likelihood of irreversible disease regardless of the combination of immune suppression used. Given these circumstances, early diagnosis is of utmost importance, and can be characterized by an isolated and subclinical decline in lung function. Recent studies have suggested that early decline in lung function on pulmonary function testing (PFT) may be representative of developing BOS.\n\nDue to the lack of consistent screening and diagnostic criteria, many patients with evolving BOS elude a timely diagnosis, thereby jeopardizing their chance of survival. In response, several experts have recommended frequent PFT screening and a modified, less stringent set of diagnostic criteria with the goal of establishing earlier diagnosis and timely intervention.\n\nTraditionally, treatment of BOS has included aggressive immunosuppression, leaving patients at risk for life-threatening invasive infections, multi-system co-morbidities, and the threat of lung transplantation. Recent studies have demonstrated that early management with agents such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), macrolides, and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) can lead to improvements in both lung function and clinical symptoms.\n\nThis study aims to evaluate the utility of frequent and routine pulmonary surveillance in pediatric patients who have undergone allogenic HSCT. Our prospective study design provides a novel framework for the implementation of standardized lung function screening every three months in the first two years following HSCT. With this, we hypothesize that standardized PFT screening will improve diagnostic sensitivity and allow for earlier intervention in patients with evolving airway obstruction and BO.\n\nThis study also aims to evaluate the efficacy of inhaled fluticasone, azithromycin, and montelukast (FAM therapy) in the management of early airflow obstruction in pediatric patients following allogenic HSCT. Early airflow obstruction is defined by pulmonary function testing (FEV1 decline of ≥10% predicted with a FVC <0.8). With this, we hypothesize that FAM therapy will attenuate the progression of airflow obstruction and improve lung function in those with irreversible airflow obstruction at one and two years when compared to historical controls."

The Headsprout reading intervention has been shown to be effective with children with various levels of reading skills, but it has not been rigorously tested in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Headsprout in a pilot sample of 18 children with ASD and reading delays to serve as a foundation for a larger, future randomized clinical trial (RCT).\n\nEighteen participants will be included in the study and randomly assigned to one of two groups; the first group will immediately receive treatment with the Headsprout reading program and the second treatment group will receive treatment after 12 weeks. Treatment sessions will occur for one to two hours, two to four days a week, for twelve weeks. The participants who do not receive treatment immediately will be asked to complete reading assessments periodically throughout their wait time. Participation may occur in clinic or via telehealth."

          "A large number of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience reading delays, yet few empirically supported reading interventions exist for this population. Reading delay can interfere with academic progress, impede vocational opportunities, hinder self-expression, and limit capacity for independent living. Accessing empirically supported interventions for reading skills can be difficult, with parents of children with ASD facing long waiting lists at specialty clinics, reflecting the simple fact that demand is greater than the supply of trained providers. There is a pressing need for access to affordable interventions that do not depend on specialty clinics.\n\nAs a commercially available, computer-based program, Headsprout may be a good fit for children with ASD. Headsprout has shown effectiveness in children with reading delay uncomplicated by ASD, but has not been rigorously studied in children with ASD. This study will investigate the effects of the Headsprout reading program on improving reading skills of children with autism. Eighteen children will be recruited and the researchers will evaluate their current language use by: 1) asking their parents to rate their child's language, 2) completing an echoic skill assessment. Current reading skills will be determined by administering a reading assessment that evaluates their reading accuracy and fluency.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups; the first group will immediately receive treatment with the Headsprout reading program and the second treatment group will receive treatment after 12 weeks. Participation may be in clinic or via telehealth. During the intervention, children will meet with a trained therapist, several times per week for approximately twelve weeks. The therapist will instruct them to complete various reading activities on the computer. These reading activities may include tasks such as receptively identifying letter names and letter sounds presented on the computer or practicing saying sounds out loud and blending combinations of sounds together.\n\nThe participants who do not receive treatment immediately will be asked to complete reading assessments periodically throughout their wait time. At the end of 12 weeks these participants will be able to start the Headsprout reading program."

Due to advances in therapy, approximately two-thirds of children with CNS tumors treated at CHCO will be cured. Although medical marijuana has been legal for more than a decade in Colorado, the publicity around the more recent legalization for general adult use, increasing literature, and anecdotal reports of patients with terminal CNS tumors cured with medical marijuana, have prompted a recent increase in interest of current CHCO patients and their families. There has been an influx of pediatric cancer patients and their families moving to Colorado to obtain these marijuana-based products to self-medicate.\n\nThe Investigators will administer PedsQLTM questionnaires and diaries to gather data regarding use practices, method of delivery, strain used, dosing and frequency, and family financial impact on all enrolled patients. The Investigators will also collect peripheral blood samples to evaluate for evidence of immuno-modulation by cannabinoids in patients who may already be immunocompromised and to assess blood cannabinoid levels.\n\nThis study will provide novel exploratory data regarding use patterns, impact on families and resources, and potential clinical benefits and harms associated with the growing marijuana use in the pediatric neuro-oncology population. Such information may guide future children afflicted with CNS tumors and their families to make decisions about whether to pursue cannabinoid treatment."

          "In previous work the investigator identified a group of children between the ages of 10-18 years whose diagnostic workup for chronic nausea unexplained by conventional diagnostic tests has unexpectedly revealed underlying cardiovascular instability manifesting as orthostatic intolerance, primary defined as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) (88%). While this is an atypical initial presentation for orthostatic intolerance in general, the investigator believes that the cardiovascular problem is serious and represents a cause of the nausea in a majority of these individuals, as treatment of the POTS with fludrocortisone reduced the symptoms of nausea. While fludrocortisone treatment abrogates the fall in baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) during tilt in part, it did not completely correct the tachycardia symptoms or the BRS suppression during HUT. Furthermore it caused an elevation in MAP in supine position, which may lead to future cardiovascular problems such as early onset hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. This argues for a different treatment approach. The investigator presents preliminary data in this application revealing that OI subjects tend to have lower 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) compared to non OI subjects."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "The investigators approach will combine HUT testing coupled with autonomic testing that includes continuous blood pressure and HR measurements, Baroreflex Sensitivity and Hear Rate Variability, to establish objective autonomic profiles, along with vascular testing including Pulse Wave Velocity, Ankle Brachial Index at rest and measures of blood volume of different compartments, Systemic Vascular Resistance and cardiac output at rest and in response to hand-grip stress. This will allow the treating physician to provide patients with a specific diagnosis, and ultimately develop data for more focused, rational treatments than currently achieved. The full vascular profile is also novel and has the potential to improve therapeutic management of the participants independent of the outcomes with the vitamin D supplementation. This study is designed to recruit 80 participants into 4 groups of 20 each. The 4 groups represent non OI (those recruited from the clinics for nausea but without a positive tilt test) or those showing orthostatic intolerance (POTS alone, OH, and syncope). The general objective of this proposal is to address this gap in knowledge by determining vascular function, the neurohumoral profile and autonomic status supine and in response to HUT in OI subjects with low vitamin D levels in comparison with subjects who test negative for OI on the HUT.\n\nThe investigators aim to examine the effect of vitamin D replacement on these measures, providing the possibility of therapeutic use of vitamin D to treat or ameliorate the symptoms associated with OI."

          "Eating unhealthy foods and not exercising regularly contributes to obesity in children. Other unhealthy behaviors, such as skipping meals can also lead to obesity. Breakfast is known to be the most important meal of the day, yet many people skip breakfast. Skipping breakfast can cause an imbalance in the hormones that control blood glucose.\n\nSkipping breakfast can affect how well insulin works at lowering blood glucose at later meal times. The impact of breakfast on glucose homeostasis is different from that of lunch and dinner. This became evident when a group of researchers studied the effect of skipping breakfast on hormone responses after subsequent isocaloric lunch and dinner in adults with Type 2 diabetes. The study showed that in Type 2 diabetics, skipping breakfast leads to increased post-prandial hyperglycemia and decreased glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) release, impairing the insulin response to hyperglycemia. Plasma free fatty acids (FFA) levels were found to be significantly higher after lunch and dinner when breakfast was omitted. It has been shown that acute elevation of FFA induces hepatic insulin resistance and increased hepatic glucose production in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and in non-diabetic controls. Impaired insulin secretion can predispose to conditions such as obesity, and other diseases.\n\nSkipping breakfast can also have a negative effect on children's ability to keep focus and attention. The CTET is a tool that can be used to directly measure attention using an EEG and is a highly sensitive measure of neural processing."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Both propofol and dexmedetomidine may be used to achieve adequate sedation conditions. Propofol has been described to produce successful conditions for completion of the intended study in almost 99% of the patients. However, in a study that reviewed outcomes when using propofol for almost 50,000 pediatric procedures, propofol was associated with stridor, laryngospasm, airway obstruction, wheezing or central apnea at a rate of 1 in 65 sedations. The need for airway and ventilation interventions which include oral/nasal airway placement, positive pressure mask ventilation and tracheal intubation occurred at a rate of 1 in 70 sedations. Hemodynamic and respiratory fluctuations of a minimum of 30% fluctuations in heart rate, blood pressure or respiratory rate occurred at a rate of 1 in 165 sedations. Another recent study cited similar incidences of hemodynamic variability with propofol as well as inhalational anesthesia in the outpatient pediatric setting.\n\nUntil 2015, dexmedetomidine had been one of the standard drugs administered for sedation in children who require radiologic diagnostic imaging studies (MRI, CT and Nuclear Medicine) in the Department of Radiology at BCH. Over 17,000 infants, children and developmentally compromised young adults had been sedated with dexmedetomidine in BCH without a cardiac or respiratory arrest, or a need to provide positive pressure assisted ventilation.\n\nThis study will determine if administration of dexmedetomidine with propofol administration will result in lower doses of the latter, which may mean safer outcomes in sedation for upper and lower endoscopic procedures."

          "The investigators will focus on three cohorts of brain tumor patients aged, 4-18 years, to answer two critical questions: 1) Can the investigators acquire high quality data relevant to cognitive function during the peri-diagnostic period and, 2) can the investigators develop predictive models for cognitive outcomes using serial examination of functional imaging and cognitive function. Any patient with a newly diagnosed brain tumor aged 4-18 will be eligible for enrollment in cohort 1. Only patients with previously diagnosed tumors of the posterior fossa will be eligible for cohort 2. For cohort 3, eligible patients will include patients with a clinical diagnosis of posterior fossa syndrome with physical impairments that prohibit completion of the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery. The investigators have decided to expand the eligible tumor types to better capture the most significant deficit variability that can be caused by tumors outside the posterior fossa. Thus, this focus will provide a platform to analyze the impact that different tumor types and different standard treatments have on cognitive dysfunction. The rationale for inclusion of subjects on cohort 3 is that posterior fossa syndrome is one of the most cognitively devastating diagnoses following a posterior fossa surgery. The causes of posterior fossa syndrome and unknown and there are currently no interventions to improve symptoms. RsfcMRI would offer a novel and non-invasive assessment of posterior fossa syndrome patients by assessing connectivity within and outside of the cerebellum. Expanding the tumor eligibility will allow us to further explore the effect tumor location will have on cognitive testing and rsfcMRI. Here, repeated evaluations on and off therapy will provide the necessary data points to establish trajectories of cognitive development and recovery in this population."

These devices which are the size and thickness of a dime will be within plastic bags taped to the patients body within the central focus of the fluoroscopy image. At the completion of the procedure the TLD's will be transferred to the Radiation Safety Office in Oakland to be read and the dose recorded.\n\nSecond, a flat chamber that is integral with all fluoroscopy machines used at Children's Hospital will measure the dose-area product (DAP) for each case which will allow us to calculate the effective dose. This device is a component of the colimeter on the arm of the x-ray machine used for fluoroscopy. It measures the radiation that is returned to the x-ray machine and calculates the dose delivered to the patient by comparing the amount delivered to the patient to the amount returned to the machine. Its use is automatic when any x-rays are delivered and does not involve any manipulation of the patient or alteration of normal procedure.\n\nNo additional procedures or change in duration is necessary for this study"

PANS is a condition characterized by the abrupt, dramatic onset of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or eating restriction accompanied by equally abrupt and severe co-morbid neuropsychiatric symptoms, which include anxiety, emotional lability, depression, irritability, aggression, oppositionality, deterioration in school performance, behavioral (developmental) regression, sensory amplification, movement abnormalities, sleep disturbance, and urinary frequency. PANS is thought to be caused by infection, inflammation, or alternate triggers that is associated with a brain response that leads to these symptoms. The purpose of this study is to examine specific neurologic, immunologic, rheumatologic, and genomic, components in children with the acute-onset of psychiatric symptoms. This research may begin to uncover a much larger story of autoimmune processes that are involved in psychiatric disorders of childhood. By better understanding the etiologic components of psychiatric phenomenon, future treatments may be better targeted to underlying causes."

          "Irritability and emotional dysregulation are recognized as serious aspects of psychopathology seen in in pediatric psychiatric patients. While various behavioral as well as psychopharmacological interventions have shown some efficacy in improving irritability and emotional dysregulation, there are no data determining the neurobiological mechanism of effect at the neural level. Previous studies have demonstrated that heightened amygdala response to negative emotional stimuli is closely related to irritability and emotional dysregulation in children and adolescents. Also, there are studies showing administration of oxytocin can decrease the heightened amygdala response to negative emotional stimuli across various psychiatric diagnoses. This study is a double-blind randomized trial of oxytocin for irritability and emotional dysregulation in the pediatric population. Neuroimaging modalities of fMRI and MEG are employed to probe the neuro-circuitry changes occurring as a result of the oxytocin intervention, specifically including heightened amygdala response to negative emotional stimuli and dysfunctional fronto-amygdala connectivity. The investigators will also investigate the genetic sequence of the oxytocin receptor in the study participants and its relationship with symptom profile and neural activity changes. Children and adolescents (age 10-18) with a diagnosis of disruptive mood and/or behavior disorders (including Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder [ADHD], Oppositional Defiant Disorder [ODD], Conduct Disorder [CD], and Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder [DMDD]), and clinically significant levels of irritability and emotional dysregulation as measured by the Affective Reactivity Index Scale (score>/= 4).\n\n2 weeks randomized, double-blind treatment with intranasal oxytocin (24 IU daily, or 12 IU daily if the weight is < 40kg) with assessment of diagnosis, symptom profiles (the Affective Reactivity Index [ARI], Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Trait [ICU], Behavior Assessment System for Children, second version [BASC-2], and Clinical Global Impression [CGI]) and pre- and post-oxytocin treatment neuroimaging (fMRI and MEG). The genetic sample will be obtained via buccal mucosa sampling.\n\nParticipants may receive outpatient clinically indicated follow-up care in the UNMC department of psychiatry or other local community agency as appropriate."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Clinical assessment\n\nStandard clinical practice at the outpatient clinic of the department of psychiatry, at University of Nebraska Medical Center involves an initial clinical interview by either a child and adolescent psychiatrist faculty member, a child and adolescent psychiatry clinical fellow, or an advanced practice registered nurse. The clinical interview includes past and current history of psychiatric symptoms/signs, past and current medical history, and past/current social/academic history. Also the current medication (if any) and any medical condition that would have interaction with the psychiatric diagnosis will be reviewed. The child/adolescent will receive the diagnosis of psychiatric syndrome at the end of the assessment sessions.\n\nRecruitment to the study\n\nParticipants diagnosed with ADHD/CD/ODD/DMDD and presence of clinically significant irritability and emotional dysregulation at the clinical assessment session will be invited to participate in this study afterwards. Participants who respond to advertisement, after a phone screening session will be also invited.\n\nInitial research assessment\n\nParticipants who agreed to be enrolled into the protocol will have the initial research assessment session afterwards. This will be held at the outpatient clinic of the department of psychiatry, at University of Nebraska Medical Center. Participants will receive the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS), to confirm the diagnosis of ADHD/CD/ODD/DMDD, and to rule out any other psychiatric diagnoses listed in the exclusion criteria. Their IQ will be measured by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (2-subtest form). Irritability and emotional dysregulation will be measured by the Affective Reactivity Index (ARI). Only the children and adolescents with diagnoses of ADHD/CD/ODD/DMDD and clinically significant level of irritability/emotional dysregulation (score >4 on the ARI) will be enrolled in the study. CBCL, ICU, RPAQ will be used to measure the symptom profiles and functional impairment of patients with ADHD/CD/ODD/DMDD at the initiation and end point of their study participation.\n\nfMRI visit 1\n\nDuring the MRI visit 1, participants will receive their first fMRI session immediately before initiation of oxytocin or placebo treatment. The fMRI visit 1 can happen on the same day of the initial research assessment after the initial research assessment is completed.\n\nThe Fearful Expression Processing task\n\nThis is a shortened version of the paradigm previously utilized by our group (Marsh & Blair, 2008). During each trial the participant is asked to decide the gender of the face displayed. The face either demonstrates neutral affect or a morphed intensity of fear (50%, 100% or 150%). A trial involves: the presentation of a face (1500 ms) and then a fixation point (1000 ms). There is one run of this task, with 120 face trials (30 neutral, 30 50% fear, 30 100% fear and 30 150% fear) and 60 fixation point trials. In addition, there are 15 seconds of fixation point trials at the beginning and end of the run. Task duration is 8 minutes.\n\nThe Affective Stroop task\n\nThe affective task used here was an adapted version of the paradigm described in previous work. During each trail the participant is asked to decide how many numbers are displayed on the screen, instead of the value of the number. For congruent trials, the numbers were displayed with the same numerosity and number value (e.g., three 3s). For incongruent trials, the numbers were displayed with different numerosities and number values (e.g., four 3s). The individual numerical stimuli consisted of three, four, five, or six 3s, 4s, 5s, or 6s randomly presented within a 9-point grid. There are an equal number of congruent trials and incongruent trials (48 each for a run). These number pictures were preceded and followed by emotional stimuli pictures consisting of 48 positive, 48 negative, and 48 neutral pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System. A trial involves: the presentation of an emotional stimuli (400ms), a numerical display (400ms), the same emotional stimuli (400ms), and a blank (1300ms). Subject completed two runs, generating 288 picture-trial events (32 in each 9 categories) and 96 fixation points to generate a baseline.\n\nMEG visit 1\n\nMEG visit 1 will take place at the Center for MEG (South Doctors Tower, Ste. 222) on the day of their scheduled study. The MEG visit 1 can happen on the same day of the initial research assessment.\n\nThe Emotional Stroop task\n\nFor the emotional Stroop task (EST), three word lists are prepared, a threat list, a negative list, and a neutral list. Each list contains 30 monosyllabic words. The threat words include things encountered in dangerous situation (e.g. gun), the negative words are negative in valence, but not related to threat (e.g., bad). The neutral words are not threatening nor negative (e.g., tune). The three words lists are equated across lexical features including: length, frequency, orthographic, and phonological neighborhood size. Using the ELP database, the words are also equated on average naming latency, naming accuracy, lexical decision time, and lexical decision accuracy (Balota et al., 2007). The task contains 9 experimental blocks, each consisting of 30 color word naming trials from one of our EST lists. The order of the words within each list is randomized across presentation blocks. Within each trial, participants first view a fixation cross for 1 second, which is replaced by a list item that remains on the screen for 2 seconds. An experimenter codes the participant's response as correct (i.e., correct color identification), incorrect (i.e., did not name a color, named the wrong color, or named the word), or as a noise trial (e.g., the participant coughs, etc.). The items are centered horizontally/vertically on a 43.5 by 35cm screen and positioned at eye-level approximately 110cm from the head. Items are presented in red, blue, or green font, and item color is randomly assigned. Reaction times are measured using a dual-plane accelerometer attached to the lower lip and digitized at 1kHz using a Grass amplifier. Voice onset is determined by a sharp increase in the amplitude of the accelerometer signal, which produces response time accuracy near 1ms.\n\nOxytocin/placebo administration\n\nIf the participants are assigned to the oxytocin treatment arm by randomization, they will be initiated on oxytocin administration after the MRI visit 1 and MEG visit 1. Following previous studies using intranasal oxytocin administration, subjects weighing >40kg will receive a total of 24 IU of oxytocin delivered as 2- 6 IU puffs to each nostril once daily. Subjects weighing <40kg will receive a total of 12 IU of oxytocin delivered as 1- 6 IU puff to each nostril daily. Participants will receive 14 to 21 days of daily oxytocin/placebo administration. After 14 days of oxytocin/placebo administration, participants will be scheduled to have MRI visit 2 and MEG visit 2. After those two visits are completed, participants will stop oxytocin/placebo administration. Participants who are assigned to placebo treatment branch will receive identical bottles and instructions for delivery of all the other ingredients of nasal spray except oxytocin. The instruction and demonstration will be given to the parents or legal guardian as the first administration of the nasal spray done at the clinic by either child and adolescent psychiatrist or advanced practice registered nurse. The daily administration will be done by dispatching either oxytocin or placebo nasal spray to the parents of the participants. The oxytocin and placebo nasal spray will be prepared by the University of Nebraska Medical Center research pharmacist who will be un-blinded to each subject's treatment assignment. The randomization will be done by the department of pharmacology by a computer-programmed randomization procedure.\n\nThe participants will have 2 weekly visits to the clinic. They will be assessed for symptom level, nasal spray tolerance, and assessment of adverse effects. Participants will be initiated on psychiatric treatment if it is indicated by change of their psychiatric condition (such as worsening of psychiatric symptoms). In this case, they will not participate in the study any more.\n\nAfter 14 days -21 days of trial and the completion of 2nd scans of MRI/MEG and final research assessment, the participants will terminate their participation in this study.\n\nMRI visit 2\n\nMRI visit 2 is identical for all participants to MRI visit 1 and will occur at least 14 days and no more than after 21 days after MRI visit 1. The final research assessment session can occur the same day of MRI visit 2.\n\nMEG visit 2\n\nMEG visit 2 is identical for all participants to MEG visit 1 and will occur at least 14 days and no more than after 21 days after MEG visit 1. The final research assessment session can occur the same day of MRI visit 2.\n\nFinal research assessment\n\nFinal research assessment session will occur at the outpatient clinic of the department of psychiatry at University of Nebraska Medical Center after the MRI visit 2 and the MEG visit 2. During this session, the child and adolescent psychiatrist and the advanced practice registered nurse who are the investigators of this study will administer follow-up assessment of current symptom severity by ARI, CBCL, ICU, RPAQ, as well as compliance with the treatment and side effects.\n\nParticipants will be discharged from the study following the final research assessment, or their request to terminate study participation.\n\nIf during the course of the study it is discovered that the participant has a disorder or condition that would disqualify him/her (e.g., unexpected side effect of oxytocin that will necessitate cessation of the treatment or medical compromise that will make it impossible to continue oxytocin treatment), but needs further evaluation, the participant will be immediately referred for further clinical assessment and intervention to an appropriate department of University of Nebraska Medical Center."

          "The researchers plan to explore brain networks involved in emotion processing and learning using a brain scan and test meals. One core feature of Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is eating a small number of high-calorie or high-fat foods. By studying why individuals with AN are disgusted by food or other eating situations, the researchers will be able to understand more about the neurobiological pathways that lead to restricting food intake and food avoidance. This study also aims to find whether one of two short-term interventions (Interoceptive Exposure (IE); Family-Based Therapy (FBT)) affects connections in the brain and if the treatments affect food avoidance. IE is an intervention that helps reduce anxiety about eating. FBT is an intervention that motivates patients to eat through working with family to increase the value of eating and decrease the value of avoiding foods."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Anorexia nervosa (AN), a characteristically relentless pursuit of thinness with an intense fear of weight gain despite significantly low body weight, is a serious psychiatric disorder with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Low weight eating disorders (LW-ED), the broader category of eating pathology that includes AN and similar variants, are characterized by a chronic course, poor response to treatment, and food avoidance. Emerging neuroimaging evidence suggests that deficits in insula-amygdala-ventral striatum (IAVS) neurocircuitry contribute to individual variability in aversive and reward learning, and that these brain regions demonstrate abnormal responses to food/eating stimuli. The researchers' pilot data suggest that patients with LW-ED experience difficulty extinguishing food-cue associations in a reversal learning paradigm compared to healthy controls, a difficulty that is related to psychophysiological measures of aversive disgust (not fear). The researchers have also successfully piloted an interoceptive exposure intervention for this population that targets visceral sensitivity and seeks to increase 'top-down' regulation of the IAVS neurocircuit. The proposed project will (a) use novel fMRI-EMG to test the relationship between effective connectivity within amygdala-insula-ventral striatum network and its relationship to psychophysiological and behavioral measures of acute threat and reward learning in 60 adolescents with LWEDs and 30 healthy controls, (b) test the sensitivity of this network to an experimental interoceptive exposure paradigm relative to patients receiving family based therapy for weight restoration using dynamic causal modeling of fMRI-EMG data pre-post experimental conditions, (c) validate this model against objective measures of laboratory and real world eating behavior. The results of this study will help better understand the core neurocircuitry that underlies both threat processing and reward/aversive learning and how this circuit relates to objective behavior. Further, the researchers will determine the modifiability of this neurocircuitry via two distinct behavioral interventions chosen to target different aspects of affective processing and reward learning. These data will be used to inform future clinical interventions targeting aversive/reward learning within this population and dysregulation in insula-amygdala-ventral striatum subcircuits."

          "Background/Question: A significant number of children who present to the Emergency Department (ED) with headache or migraine undergo head imaging with Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, there is relatively low yield in imaging neurologically normal patients based on prior studies. The goal of this study is to describe the utilization of head CT or MRI among pediatric ED patients with headache and migraine. The investigators plan to evaluate clinical and examination characteristics of these patients, and use this information to develop a clinical decision rule to help providers predict the risk of finding an abnormality that affects patient treatment.\n\nDesign: The investigators will perform a study of all children between 6 and 18 years of age who present to the ED with headache or migraine. At the time of the visit providers will be asked to complete a questionnaire regarding exam and history without making any changes to patient care. The investigators will also contact a sub-group of patients who do not undergo MRI or CT, 12-14 weeks after discharge to ask about subsequent headache care after leaving our facility.\n\nMethods: All children age 6-18 years who present to the ED with a chief complaint of headache or migraine will be eligible for the study. Patients will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria: trauma within 48 hours, previous neurosurgery (shunt included), known tumor, history of cerebral hemorrhage/ischemia, Sickle Cell Disease, thrombophilia, bleeding disorder or non-English speaker. ED Research Assistants and ED staff physicians and nurse practitioners will screen potential candidates and ask providers to review the inclusion criteria. If the eligibility criteria are met, the provider will complete a standardized data collection form regarding exam and history findings. Patient care will not be impacted or altered. Research Assistants will also provide a Parent Information Sheet (either during the visit, or by mail following the ED visit) to the family of those patients who are enrolled informing them they may be contacted following discharge. Medical records will be reviewed for all eligible patients to obtain information on patient demographics, course of treatment and diagnosis. For those patients who do not have any head CT or MRI performed at their visit, the family will be contacted 12-14 weeks later to determine if they have had subsequent care for their headache. If the family is unable to be reached by phone, the patient chart will be reviewed for any other pertinent visits.\n\nAnalysis: For each patient characteristic examined, the investigators will look for a statistically significant difference between those patients who have normal head imaging, and those with abnormal imaging. Using the characteristics that are significantly different, the investigators will develop a clinical decision rule to help providers assess the risk of significant findings in an individual patient. The investigators will also develop a decision tree to help aid providers when deciding which patients need head imaging. A sample of patients will have two independent assessments to allow us to look for evidence of inter-rater reliability in our questionnaires."

All consented patients will be randomly allocated by a statistician to either the experimental group where participants will undergo SKBRS exercises in addition to their routine vestibular rehabilitation regimen, or to the control group where participants will undergo routine vestibular rehabilitation exercises without the SKBRS.\n\nAll subjects will undergo weekly vestibular rehabilitation sessions for 3 months (a total of 12 sessions). During these sessions, standard balance training exercises will be done at the discretion of the therapists. Experimental subjects will also undergo 15 minutes of SKBRS exercises during each standard vestibular rehabilitation session. This device uses video-based exercises and a non-invasive vibrotactile belt to measure the subject's position in space and trunk tilt/sway while performing various balance tasks.\n\nAll subjects will undergo the following 3 routine tests throughout the course of the therapy to determine their progress: The Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) to measure the subject's static balance, the Clinical Test of Sensory Integration and Balance (CTSIB), an office-based version of the computerized dynamic postuography test, and the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), which measures dynamic balance. Finally, the investigators will ask all subjects to provide their subjective opinion of their vestibular rehabilitation program and their opinion of the SKBRS by filling out questionnaires.\n\nThe primary outcome measure is a comparison of relative balance improvement between subjects who underwent standard vestibular rehabilitation exercises and those who underwent additional therapy with the SKBRS during their rehab sessions. This progress will be measured by the degree of change in the BESS, CTSIB, and DGI scores between subjects' first and final vestibular rehabilitation sessions. The secondary outcome will be the subjects' subjective assessments of the effectiveness of their vestibular rehabilitation (measured by the VRBQ) as well as the experimental subjects' feedback on the SKBRS device (measured by the SKBRS feedback survey)."

          "Leukodystrophies, and other heritable disorders of the white matter of the brain, were previously resistant to genetic characterization, largely due to the extreme genetic heterogeneity of molecular causes. While recent work has demonstrated that whole genome sequencing (WGS), has the potential to dramatically increase diagnostic efficiency, significant questions remain around the impact on downstream clinical management approaches versus standard diagnostic approaches."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Leukodystrophies are a group of approximately 30 genetic diseases that primarily affect the white matter of the brain, a complex structure composed of axons sheathed in myelin, a glial cell-derived lipid-rich membrane. Leukodystrophies are frequently characterized by early onset, spasticity and developmental delay, and are degenerative in nature. As a whole, leukodystrophies are relatively common (approximately 1 in 7000 births or almost twice as prevalent as Prader-Willi Syndrome, which has been far more extensively studied) with high associated health-care costs; however, more than half of the suspected leukodystrophies do not have a definitive diagnosis, and are generally classified as \"leukodystrophies of unknown etiology\". Even when a diagnosis is achieved, the diagnostic process lasts an average of eight years and results in test expenses in excess of $8,000 on average per patient, including the majority of patients who never achieve a diagnosis at all. These diagnostic challenges represent an urgent and unresolved gap in knowledge and disease characterization, as obtaining a definitive diagnosis is of paramount importance for leukodystrophy patients. The diagnostic workup begins with findings on cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) followed by sequential targeted genetic testing, however next generation sequencing technologies (NGS) offer the promise of rapid and more cost effective approaches.\n\nDespite significant advances in diagnostic efficacy, there are still significant issues with respect to implementation of NGS in clinical settings. First, sample cohorts demonstrating diagnostic efficacy are generally small, retrospective, and susceptible to ascertainment bias, ultimately rendering them poor candidates for utility analyses (to determine how efficient a test is at producing a diagnosis). Second, historic sample cohorts have not been examined prospectively for information about impact on clinical management (whether the test results in different clinical monitoring, a change in medications, or alternate clinical interventions).\n\nTo address these issues, the study team conducted an investigation of patients with suspected leukodystrophies or other genetic disorders affecting the white matter of the brain at the time of initial confirmation of MRI abnormalities, with prospective collection of patients randomly received on a \"first come, first served\" basis from a network of expert clinical sites. Subjects were randomized to receive early (1 month) or late (6 months) WGS, with SoC clinical analyses conducted alongside WGS testing. An interim analysis performed in May 2018 assessed these study outcomes for a cohort of thirty-four (34) enrolled subjects. Two of these subjects were resolved before complete enrollment and were retained as controls. Nine subjects were stratified to the Immediate Arm, of which 5 (55.6%) were resolved by WGS and 4 (44.4%) were persistently unresolved. Of the 23 subjects randomized to the Delayed Arm, 14 (60.9%) were resolved by WGS and 5 (21.7%) by SoC, while the remaining 4 (17.4%) remained undiagnosed. The diagnostic efficacy of WGS in both arms was significant relative to SoC (p<0.005). The time to diagnosis was significantly shorter in the immediate WGS group (p<0.05). The overall diagnostic efficacy of the combination of WGS and SoC approaches was 26/34 (76.5%; 95% CI = 58.8% to 89.3%) over <4 months, greater than historical norms of <50% over more than 5 years.\n\nThe study now seeks to determine whether WGS results in changes to clinical management in subjects affected by undiagnosed genetic disorders of the white matter of the brain relative to standard diagnostic approaches. We anticipate that WGS will produce measurable downstream changes in clinical management, as defined by disease-specific screening for complications or implementation of disease-specific therapeutic approaches."

This means that we will only enroll 3 participants at a time and give them rTMS at the stimulation intensity energy of 80% of motor threshold (MT). If all three participants complete the 6 weeks of treatment with no major safety events (i.e. seizure), we will increase the energy for the next 3 participants by 5%. If 1 of the 3 participants has a major safety event, we will enroll 3 more patients at the SAME energy. We will proceed in this manner, increasing by 5% after 3 subjects safely complete treatment at that energy, to a maximum energy of 120% of motor threshold. If 2 participants in each intensity level cohort experience a major safety event, we will discontinue running subjects at that energy level. If this happens at our initial energy level of 80% of MT, we will stop the study. If we reach 2 events in any of the higher energy cohorts, we will return to the previous energy level and complete the remainder of the subjects at that energy level."

This initial evaluation will be done using the Kiddie Schedule of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS-PL 2009) and the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R). Participants and their families will also be asked to complete the Antidepressant Treatment Report (ATR), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS), Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS), Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Edinburgh Handedness Scale, the Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) and the Tanner Pubertal Staging Questionnaire. Participants will also be asked to complete the NIH Toolbox, Children's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (CAVLT), and the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Trail Making Test.\n\nAdolescents with TRD who fit inclusion/exclusion criteria (presence of major depression with CDRS-R raw score > 40; a history of at least one failed treatment trial with an antidepressant [as defined by the Antidepressant Treatment Report]; no history of seizure disorder; no presence of MRI contraindications [e.g. claustrophobia or metallic implants]) will be scheduled for:\n\nA. A baseline MRI (described below)\n\nB. 6 weeks of the series of rTMS visits described below\n\nC. A post-treatment MRI\n\nD. A post-treatment clinical assessment (blinded to treatment assignment)\n\nE. 6 monthly follow up visits\n\nIn the first rTMS visit, the study physician will fit the cap, determine the ideal location for stimulation, and measure MT and MEPa. Adolescents will receive 6 weeks of rTMS, 20 minutes/day, 5 days/week administered by a trained technician. Active treatment will be 43 trains of 10 Hz, stimulation intensity will vary as described above, inter-train interval 20 seconds, 1680 pulses/session. A member of research staff will meet weekly with patients to complete the CDRS-R, monitor treatment tolerance using the Side Effects Form for Children and Adolescents, and measure the MT and MEPa. Adolescents will also complete the BDI-II, C-SSRS-SLV, IDAS, TEPS, YMRS, and SHAPS weekly. At week four, the participants will be asked to repeat the NIH Toolbox, Children's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (CAVLT), and the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Trail Making Test.\n\nScanning will take place at the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research on a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner at baseline (after the clinical assessment, before the first treatment) and after the last rTMS treatment. Participants will complete MRI safety forms and provide a urine sample to rule out substance use (all participants) and pregnancy (females only). A high-resolution T1 image will be collected (voxel size=1mm isotropic; TR=2530ms; TE=3.65ms, T1=1100ms, flip angle=7°, 5 minutes). Functional data will be acquired using the Human Connectome Project (HCP)38 multiband echo planar imaging sequence (whole brain T2*-weighted functional volumes, 72 contiguous slices; TR=720ms; TE=34.2ms; flip angle=55o, FOV=212mm; voxel size=2mm isotropic; matrix=106x106; multiband factor=8; 12 minutes) during rest with eyes open while viewing a fixation cross.\n\nParticipants will be asked to complete a task fMRI in which they are presented with a series of visual stimuli, (human faces of varying emotion expressions with positive, negative or neutral words printed over the faces). During the task, participants will be asked to decide whether the words printed over the faces are positive or negative regardless of the emotion of the face shown. Each subject will complete four distinct blocks of the task.\n\nAfter the completion of rTMS sessions, all participants will undergo a final assessment during which they will be asked to meet with evaluators again to complete the CDRS-R. They will also be asked to complete the BDI-II, C-SSRS, TEPS, SHAPS, IDAS and NIH Toolbox.\n\nAfter the completion of all rTMS sessions, participants will be asked to return to see researchers every month for 6 months to assess length of treatment response."

Participants will be offered enrollment in either the randomized trial or a concurrent observational cohort, which may be more feasible for families who live further away and have alternative insurance plans (Kaiser). The results of the concurrent observational cohort can be reported at a later time.\n\nEnrollment will begin in April 2015 and end in April 2016. This is to ensure that patients who may miss an appointment can still be recruited in the following months.\n\nBaseline variables will be collected prior to randomization including questionnaire and baseline characteristics such as age, creatinine, weight, height, BMI, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, donor specific antibody levels, and blood pressure will be recorded. Blood draws will be done per standard of care only and blood samples will not be stored for research purposes. Computer-generated random treatment assignments will be made based on permuted blocks (randomly generated blocks of 3).\n\nThe experimental arm will have all participants attend monthly renal transplant adolescent clinic where the participant will undergo a 25-question baseline questionnaire focusing on the participant's current knowledge of own medical condition, medications, medication dosage, insurance coverage, daily fluid goal, blood pressure goal, voiding schedule, etc.\n\nDuring each clinic visit, the participant will take the questionnaire and review results with the transplant/research coordinator. The transplant/research coordinator will also assist the participant in updating medication list, medication schedule, lab schedule, clinic appointment schedule, pharmacy refill schedule etc. using an electronic device with downloadable mobile apps. The included apps will be MyFitnessPal, a calorie counter and exercise tracker, Blood Pressure Lite (Codulis) for blood pressure recording, and Med Coach (GreatCall, Inc), providing medication and appointment reminders. If the participant already has a personal i-Phone, the study coordinator will assist the participant add schedules to the calendar and help set alarms and reminders. The research coordinator will also help download free mobile apps that will log BP, fluid intake, caloric intake, and exercise duration. If the participant does not have an i-Phone, an i-Pad Mini will be provided and the transplant coordinator will assist with all that as stated above. The participant will be seen by a nephrologist, social worker, and psychologist.\n\nThe non-technological group participants will also attend monthly renal transplant adolescent clinic where he/she will undergo the same 25-question baseline questionnaire. During each clinic visit, the participant will take the questionnaire and review results with the research coordinator. The transplant coordinator will also assist the participant in updating medication list, medication schedule, lab schedule, clinic appointment schedule, pharmacy refill schedule etc. using paper calendar and pre-printed paper logs per the routine care protocol. The participant will also be seen by a nephrologist, social worker, and psychologist.\n\nThe primary measure is performance on monthly medical knowledge questionnaire, used as a surrogate marker for readiness to transition to adult care. Secondary measures include medication adherence measured by immunosuppression target drug levels, clinic and laboratory no-show rates, markers of graft function measured by blood pressure readings, BMI, creatinine clearance, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, and episodes of rejections measured by donor specific antibodies, and pathologic findings of allograft biopsy. The study will end after the one year follow up period is completed. As the paper-based strategy is to function as a control, the investigators do not anticipate an early termination to the study, particularly since both groups provide more intervention than the current standard of care."

          "Background:\n\nWhen children have severe irritability and temper outbursts, they can be so cranky or angry that it leads to problems at home, in school, and with friends. This is called Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) and there have been no psychological treatments developed specifically for children with this problem. Researchers think two forms of therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Interpretation Bias Training (IBT), might help children with DMDD.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test two whether IBT and CBT can decrease severe irritability in children and youth.\n\nEligibility:\n\nChildren 8-17 years old with DMDD. Their symptoms must have started before age 10.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a review of their symptoms. Parents and participants will answer questions.\n\nParticipants can do only one or both of these treatments if they wish. Those who wish to do both will start with IBT.\n\nParticipants who do CBT will have 12-16 weekly meetings of research talk therapy. A parent will participate in part of the sessions.\n\nParticipants will talk about what makes them irritable and how it affects them. They may be put in situations that might make them annoyed or irritable.\n\nParticipants will rate how intense their irritability is. Parents and participants will complete rating scales, questionnaires, and interviews.\n\nParticipants will do practice activities at home.\n\nParticipants doing IBT will have up to 14 sessions over 10 weeks.\n\nParticipants will view 15 faces, one at a time, on a computer. They will choose if the face looks happy or angry on a computer. Sometimes the computer gives feedback. Participants will complete some sessions at the NIH and some at home.\n\nParticipants and parents answer questions about their progress."

          "OBJECTIVE:\n\nThis purpose of this protocol is to further the development of two potential non-pharmacologic treatments for youths with chronic, severe and impairing irritability. The first potential treatment is Interpretation Bias Training (IBT), a computer-based training designed to shift emotional judgments of ambiguous faces away from angry, and toward happy, judgments. The first component of this protocol includes a randomized, controlled trial of active IBT in youth with severe irritability. The second potential treatment is a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting severe irritability. The goal of this protocol is to conduct a preliminary study using a randomized within-subjects multiple-baseline design to test the efficacy of a new manualized exposure-based CBT with parenting training in the treatment of severe irritability.\n\nObjective 1: Assess the efficacy of Interpretation Bias Training (IBT) in youths with severe irritability, operationalized as those meeting criteria for DSM-5 Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD). To accomplish this objective, we will conduct a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) of active IBT in 40 youths with DMDD. Subjects will be randomized to receive four IBT training sessions (active vs. placebo, in a double-blind design) over four days followed by weekly mood ratings for two weeks. Primary outcome measures in this trial will assess changes in irritability using the Affective Reactivity Index (ARI: clinician-rated, parent-rated, and child-rated) and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I). After completing the RCT, all participants will be offered four open, active IBT sessions, delivered on the same schedule as in the RCT and using the same primary outcome measures.\n\nObjective 2: Test the efficacy of a new manualized CBT for severe, impairing irritability in youth. To accomplish this objective, we will utilize a within-subjects multiple baseline design (Onghena & Edgington, 2005; Gliner, Morgan, Harmon, & Harmon, 2000; Morgan & Morgan, 2001). The children will be randomized to their start times. Clinical ratings, as well as parent- and child- report ratings will be obtained every two weeks (plus or minus seven days) during both the baseline and active periods. This is not an RCT. All children will receive active CBT following variable (randomized) start times. Consistent with the manual we will continue to meet with children and their parents utilizing newly manualized exposure-based CBT procedures, such as eliciting hierarchies of irritability inducing events, exposure exercises (e.g., in-vivo, role-play, imaginal) and parent training. We will conduct the CBT on N=40 youth with severe, impairing irritability. Primary outcome measures for CBT will assess changes in irritability using the ARI (clinician-rated, parent-rated, and child-rated) and CGI-I.\n\nSecondary Objective 1a and 1b: Assess the effect of IBT on clinical measures of depression, anxiety, and functional impairment.\n\nSecondary Objective 2: Assess the effect of the CBT for irritability on clinical measures of depression, anxiety, and functional impairment.\n\nSubjects can participate in one or both of these potential treatments. If they opt to do both, there will be a four-week wash-out period between treatments.\n\nSTUDY POPULATION:\n\nThe study is taking place at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). All outpatients, ages 8-17, enrolled in NIMH-DIRP Protocol 02-M-0021, who are in stable treatment in the community will be invited to participate in this study.\n\nDESIGN:\n\nThe first part of the protocol will involve conducting a randomized controlled trial of IBT in 40 youths who meet criteria for DMDD. The goal of this novel, potential treatment is to decrease the severity of the child s irritability.\n\nThe second part of the protocol will involve conducting a randomized within-subjects multiple-baseline trial of CBT targeting severe irritability including N=40 youth.\n\nSubjects can elect to participate in the IBT randomized controlled trial only, CBT treatment or both. If subjects elect to participate in both IBT and CBT, there will be a one-month wash-out period in between.\n\nOUTCOME MEASURES:\n\nThe main outcome measures will assess changes in irritability using the ARI (clinician-rated, parent-rated, and child-rated, original and revised versions for IBT and CBT, respectively) and CGI-I. Secondary measures include parent and self-report measures of depression, anxiety, anger, social status, and aggression, as well as clinician ratings of depression, anxiety, and impairment. Data for ecological momentary assessments (EMA) will be collected using secure technology, with procedures approved by the NIMH ISSO; subjects and their caregivers will be asked a set of questions relating to recent experiences and emotions"

          "Children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for cancer or blood disorders frequently develop gastrointestinal, metabolic and infectious complications related to preparative high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation-related toxicity. Parenteral nutrition (PN) with lipid emulsion is commonly required while gastrointestinal complications preclude adequate oral or enteral intake. PN and lipids may increase the risk of metabolic and infectious complications in HCT patients who are inherently immune compromised.\n\nSupplementation with omega-3 fatty acids has been linked to improvements in outcomes in several populations. Provision of fish oil lipid emulsion (FOLE), rich in omega-3 fatty acids, to children undergoing HCT is an innovative nutritional strategy that could mitigate the metabolic and inflammatory side effects of HCT and its treatment. With its potential to safely maintain essential fatty acid status, normalize blood lipids and alleviate the inflammatory response to illness, the use of FOLE may reduce the risk of infections, regimen-related toxicity, and other morbidities after HCT.\n\nA randomized, controlled pilot study is proposed to test the safety and tolerability of FOLE, compared to standard lipid emulsion, in 20 children during hospitalization for HCT. Results of this study will provide the preliminary data needed for a larger clinical trial examining the effect of FOLE on important clinical outcomes in this population. This novel approach to nutritional care of this high-risk group will advance clinical knowledge of the impact of FOLE, and will support further investigation into nutritional adjuncts to pediatric cancer treatment."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Parenteral nutrition (PN) is often necessary for children undergoing allogeneic allogeneic bone marrow, cord, or peripheral blood stem cell (from any donor, including haploidentical donor) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to avoid malnutrition and growth failure due to the gastrointestinal toxicity associated with preparative myeloablative conditioning regimens. Intravenous lipid emulsion is a required component of PN to provide energy and essential fatty acids when oral or enteral intake is nil or minimal. Soybean oil lipid emulsion (SOLE) is the standard lipid emulsion used in PN. Complications such as metabolic instability, cholestasis, hypertriglyceridemia, and anorexia, which are common during HCT, may also be attributable to the SOLE component of PN. Fish oil based lipid emulsion (FOLE) is used in certain populations and is associated with improved outcomes, specifically in infants with intestinal failure and PN associated cholestasis. It has been reported that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil emulsion may preserve lean body mass, improve quality of life, and decrease length of hospital stay. Provision of FOLE to children undergoing HCT is a novel and innovative strategy to potentially mitigate the metabolic and inflammatory side effects of HCT and its treatment.\n\nHYPOTHESIS: The provision of FOLE is safe and well tolerated in children following HCT. Our aims are to determine the safety profile (as measured by the number of grade 2 or higher adverse events) and tolerability of intravenous FOLE (as measured by serum fatty acid profiles) among children undergoing HCT compared to children receiving SOLE.\n\nHYPOTHESIS: The provision of FOLE is associated with reduced incidence of hypertriglyceridemia in children following HCT, compared to children receiving SOLE and our aim is to determine the number (and percentage) of subjects with fasting hypertriglyceridemia during the trial. To explore trends in associations with other relevant outcomes, other exploratory outcomes (inflammatory biomarkers, body composition measurements, and quality of life indicators) will be assessed in both groups of children following HCT.\n\nMETHODS: This is a randomized, controlled, unblinded pilot study to test the safety and tolerability of FOLE, compared to standard SOLE, in children hospitalized for HCT with an underlying hematologic malignancy or myelodysplasic syndrome.\n\nChildren cared for in the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center and who will be admitted to BCH for allogeneic HCT will be enrolled (10 subjects in each arm). Patients will be included if they meet all of the entry criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.\n\nAll enrolled subjects will receive standard transplant and medical care per HCT guidelines and protocols. A baseline study visit will occur between 14 and 7 days prior to transplant day (day 0). Regardless of enteral intake, at day 0, subjects will be randomized to either control or experimental lipid infusion. The experimental group will receive FOLE and the control group will receive SOLE beginning at day 0 of HCT. All patients, in both the control and experimental groups, will receive standard nutritional care as follows:\n\nThe energy goal for each patient will be the measured resting energy expenditure REE, or the estimated energy expenditure determined and calculated by the clinical dietitian, to be provided by oral, enteral, and/or parenteral energy intake. Intravenous lipids will provide approximately 10 kcal/kg/day. Energy intake from other sources (oral intake, enteral feeding, PN) will be titrated to meet the individualized energy goal, accounting for the contribution from intravenous lipids.\nPN (i.e., dextrose/amino acids) will be initiated if oral or enteral energy intake declines to less than estimated or measured (REE) for >3-5 days, but no earlier than \"day 0\" of the transplant course.\nAmino acids in PN will be provided according to standard, age-adjusted estimations, minus any contributions from oral or enteral protein intake.\nLipids will be provided to all enrolled subjects at 1 g/kg/day. On the first day of the lipid infusion, lipids will be infused over 18 hours through a central or peripheral venous line per standard procedures.\nA lipid panel will be obtained 4 hours after the 1st lipid infusion is completed and while the subject is nil per os (NPO) for at least 2 hours.\nShould the subject have hypertriglyceridemia >500 mg/dL with associated abdominal pain, an amylase/lipase level will be drawn to screen for pancreatitis.\nIf required (or requested) and after tolerating day 1 of the initial 18-hour lipid infusion, the lipid infusion rate may be changed and lipids may be infused over a range of 8 to 20 hours if the rate does not exceed the maximal lipid infusion rate\nThe control group will receive standard SOLE, a 20% lipid solution (Intralipid®, Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL, USA).\nThe experimental group will receive FOLE (Omegaven®, Fresenius Kabi AG, Bad Homburg v.d.h., Germany), a 10% lipid solution. The experimental product, Omegaven®, will be purchased from the manufacturer, stored in BCH Research Pharmacy, and labeled appropriately. The experimental product will not be altered in any way from its original manufactured state and may be infused in the same manner as standard SOLE.\nAfter engraftment occurs (3 consecutive days with absolute neutrophil count >500), lipids will be discontinued at day 30, if clinically indicated, or when the patient is ready for hospital discharge, whichever comes first.\nLipid rates of 0.15 g fat/kg/hour have been associated with fat overload syndrome; all rates are below this threshold.\n\nStandardized demographic and clinical assessments of all study participants will be performed via medical record review concomitant with the hospitalization and selected clinic visits. Data will include medical record number, underlying diagnosis, type of donor, date of transplant, date of birth, gender, conditioning and prophylactic medication regimens. Results of routine laboratory tests (serum chemistries, blood cell counts) will be recorded twice weekly. Essential fatty acid profiles, pediatric lipid panels, and inflammatory markers will be assessed at specified intervals.\n\nBody weight will be measured by an electronic digital scale accurate to 0.1 kg (same scale used at all visits). Standing height will be measured by stadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm (same stadiometer used at all visits). Oral and enteral nutrient intake during the inpatient admission period of the study will be evaluated through standard nursing documentation and calorie counts. Daily calorie counts are routine practice in the HCT unit. Nutrient intake will be tabulated from 24-hour recall at outpatient visits. The total enteral and oral intake of calories, protein, carbohydrate, and fat will be calculated by nutrient analysis software (ESHA Food Processor, ESHA Research, Inc., Salem, OR). Parenteral intake will be calculated by the BCH pharmacy's specifications for PN, lipid emulsions, and intravenous fluid. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (Peds QL 4.0) Generic Core and SCT Modules are reliable, validated tools for measuring health related quality of life in children and adolescents ages 2 to 18 with items specific to children who have had HCT. Separate parent and age-appropriate child questionnaires that address similar questions regarding quality of life will be administered at baseline, day +30, and day +100. Air-displacement plethysmography (ADP) is a non-invasive, quick and accurate measure of body density. ADP (BOD POD, Cosmed USA, Concord CA) will be used at specified intervals to estimate body composition (percent body fat and percent lean mass) in subjects.\n\nIndividual subjects will be withdrawn from the study if they develop:\n\nuncontrolled bleeding attributed to the use of Omegaven\npersistent fasting hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride level > 500 mg/dl on 3 separate occasions, obtained 4 hours after the lipid infusion has been completed and while the subject is NPO for at least 2 hours)\npersistent essential fatty acid deficiency (triene:tetraene >0.2 for 2 consecutive measurements)\nintolerance or allergy to the assigned lipid emulsion\nparent or guardian request\nprincipal investigator believes withdrawal is in the best medical interest of the patient\nbaseline fasting (NPO for 2 hours) triglyceride level > 500 mg/dL on 2 consecutive measurements\n\nStudy discontinuation will occur:\n\nupon recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board\ntwo or more serious adverse events, occurring across different subjects, possibly or probably related to study participation.\n\nAdverse events for each study arm will be tabulated and categorized by grade. Incidence of adverse events will be presented graphically in a dot plot with each adverse event listed on the vertical axis, incidence displayed as a percentage on the horizontal axis, with different markers for each study. The primary endpoint, the number of adverse events that are grade 2 or higher, will be summarized as mean ± SD. Comparison of the primary endpoint across study arms will be assessed by the two one-sided tests procedure.\n\nThis consists of testing:\n\nH1o: μFOLE - μSOLE ≤ θ1 vs H1a: μFOLE - μSOLE > θ1 H2o: μFOLE - μSOLE ≥ θ2 vs H2a: μFOLE - μSOLE < θ2. Equivalence will be declared only if both H1o and H2o are rejected, each at α = 0.05. This is equivalent to testing that the 1 - 2α confidence interval for μFOLE - μSOLE is contained within the equivalence interval [θ1, θ2]. If the distribution of adverse events is more skewed than expected, then a lognormal distribution will be assumed."

          "The prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) is relatively low in childhood (i.e., 1-3%), but increases substantially during adolescence. By the age of 18, approximately 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD. A growing body of research implicates abnormalities in reward circuitry as playing a critical role in the development and maintenance of depressive symptoms in adolescents. Importantly, these reward-circuitry abnormalities have been linked to anhedonia (i.e., decreased pleasure or blunted reactivity to rewarding stimuli). Behavioral Activation (BA) represents a promising - and relatively simple to deliver - nonpharmacologic intervention for adolescent depression, which has been shown to be at least as effective as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with regards to symptom reduction and lowering the risk of relapse in adult samples. More recently, promising data have emerged from the application of BA to depressed adolescents. BA can be conceptualized as a treatment directly targeting anhedonia. More specifically, BA targets anhedonia through behavioral change strategies aimed at gradually increasing patients' exposure to and engagement with rewarding stimuli and positively reinforcing experiences. Given this treatment focus, BA may be particularly beneficial for adolescents struggling with relatively elevated levels of anhedonic symptoms. Accordingly, the present study will examine the role of anhedonia and reward functioning in predicting treatment response in BA. In addition, analyses will be conducted examining the reward-related neural and behavioral mechanisms underlying anhedonic symptom improvement in BA."

        "BriefSummary": [
          "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) exists in 20-50% of the 3 million adolescents annually enrolled in outpatient mental health and substance use treatment. Adolescents with ADHD present deficits in attention, self-regulation, and social competence that significantly impede achievement of developmental and educational milestones. Currently there are only two evidence-based treatment options for this age group: academic training and stimulant medications. Both options remain vastly underutilized. Academic training is not available in most school settings and rarely implemented in clinical care. Similarly, ADHD medications are rarely utilized with adolescents in primary or specialty care for a host of reasons related to stigma, misinformation about effects and side effects, and adolescent autonomy issues. Moreover, the widespread fragmentation of pharmacological versus behavioral services prevents families from making informed treatment selections.\n\nThe primary objective of this randomized parametric trial is to compare the effectiveness of behavioral only versus integrated (behavioral plus medication decision-making) interventions for adolescents with ADHD in outpatient behavioral services. The behavioral intervention, Changing Academic Support in the Home for Adolescents with ADHD (CASH-AA), contains three components: ADHD psychoeducation, family-based motivational interventions, and academic training. The medication decision-making intervention, Medication Integration Protocol (MIP), contain three components: psychoeducation about ADHD medication, family decision-making, and medication management. The study will compare the effects of two legitimate treatment options for adolescents with ADHD on service utilization, behavioral symptoms, and quality of life. It will generate new evidence on patient-centered treatment selection that aligns with family-specific principles and treatment goals.\n\nThis parametric comparative trial will randomly assign 140 inner-city adolescents with ADHD to (1) CASH-AA Only or (2) CASH-AA + MIP. Treatment will occur in community behavioral health clinics. All participants will receive behavioral interventions (CASH-AA): family psychoeducation in ADHD symptoms, executive functioning, and developmental impacts; family-based motivation and ADHD accommodation interventions; and academic training focused on home environment support and organizational skills. Half of the participants will also receive medication decision-making interventions (MIP): ADHD medication psychoeducation, family decision-making interventions, and (for those who elect to start medication) coordinated medication management. Half of the sample will have comorbid substance use problems. Treatment will occur in three community clinics; therapists will be randomly assigned to study condition. Caregivers and adolescents will complete assessments at baseline, 3, 6, and 12-month follow-up. Multilevel modeling will compare the effectiveness of each condition on key patient and service use outcomes. Patient-centered analyses will explore differential treatment effects based on (a) Medication decision (yes/no); (b) Substance use comorbidity (yes/no); (c) Race/Ethnicity (Hispanic, African American).\n\nQuantitative outcome analyses will test for service use effects, symptom reduction, and quality of life improvements that are primary reasons for seeking clinical services. Qualitative interviews will document family-specific rationale for decisions about medication, compliance with behavioral and medication interventions, and suggestions for improving services and service integration. Note that families assigned to CASH-AA Only will retain the option of pursuing ADHD medication through treatment-as-usual procedures at their respective clinic. Similarly, families assigned to CASH-AA + MIP will not be required to start ADHD medication. Instead, they will receive informed-choice interventions and can choose when and if to start medication; the study will assess the impact of these decisions on clinical outcomes.\n\nIf proven efficacious, the CASH-AA and MIP protocols could be rapidly disseminated individually or as an integrated protocol into routine behavioral healthcare settings. The protocols can also be readily combined with other behavioral treatments to form a multicomponent treatment package for adolescents with co-occurring behavior problems. In addition, the family-based, patient-centered CASH-AA and MIP protocols could be delivered in conjunction with other family-based treatments or with individual approaches that flexibly include caregivers in multiple treatment sessions. This makes CASH-AA and MIP highly efficient clinical resources for addressing ADHD-related problems in any outpatient setting that serves adolescents and their families."

          "Typically doctors adjust the settings on the ventilator to ensure that children receive enough help to decrease the work they perform to breathe, receive enough oxygen through the machine to pass into the blood and to the organs, and remove acid that builds up in the blood. However, sometimes the settings we choose can result in damage to the lungs. We are trying to find a better way to determine the best ventilator settings, which can minimize potential damage to the lungs, and still provide children with enough support to decrease the work they have to do to breathe. We believe we can personalize these choices for each child by looking at the pressure that is generated in the chest while children breathe with the ventilator. This is accomplished by using a small tube which goes through the nose and into the esophagus or stomach, which is hooked up to a computer or the ventilator to monitor pressure. This same tube can then also be used to monitor how much work children need to do to breathe as we are turning down the ventilator in preparation to remove the breathing tube."

          "Any patient weighing >2 kg between the ages of > 37 weeks corrected gestational age and <18 years who is intubated and mechanically ventilated will be eligible for the study. We seek to group patients into 3 potential cohorts:\n\ni. Normal Lungs (maximum 30 patients): Mechanically ventilated patients without pulmonary parenchymal disease or lower airway disease as measured by flow volume loops consistent with expiratory flow obstruction (e.g. seizures, apnea, upper airway obstruction). ii. AHRF (maximum 15 patients): Mechanically ventilated patients with two consecutive Saturation to FiO2 (SF) ratio < 265 or PaO2 to FiO2 (PF) ratio < 300 (e.g. pneumonia, ARDS). iii. Obstructive airway disease (15 patients): Mechanically ventilated patients with flow volume loops consistent with expiratory flow obstruction (e.g. asthma, bronchiolitis).\n\nPatients with a corrected gestational age of < 37 weeks or above 18 years of age. Patients with esophageal pathology or inability to utilize an esophageal probe due to anatomy, those on a high frequency oscillator or jet ventilator and those with uncorrected or persistent cyanotic congenital heart diseases will be excluded. Also, patients with an endotracheal tube leak of more than 18% or inability to measure volume, pressure or flow at the endotracheal tube will be excluded from the study.\n\nParticipation of this study can last for the duration of mechanical ventilation as pulmonary measurements will be taken during the initial phase as well as during the weaning phase of mechanical ventilation. Once patients are enrolled and informed consents obtained, an esophageal catheter will be inserted and remain in place until after extubation. The available catheters (7 and 16 French) used will be similar to size of feeding tubes used for intubated patients. These catheters/feeding tubes are often used in PICU and NICUs and are FDA 510K approved. There has been published data from our PICU for the use of these catheters in the neonatal population. For neonates and younger patients 2 kg to 10 kg, we will be using the 7Fr catheters. For older patients > 10 kg, we will be using the 16 Fr catheters. Patients that are intubated and not in the study have similar sized feeding catheters (that do not have the manometer function) routinely placed by bedside nursing staff for feeding or temperature monitoring purposes. The esophageal catheters function as both a manometer as well as a feeding tube that stays in place for the duration of mechanical ventilation. The manometer part of the catheter is located at the 1/3 of the catheter while the same catheter's distal port that serves as a feeding tube projects into the stomach. We will limit our placement of the esophageal catheter to three attempts per day. Once it is in optimal position, there will not be a need to re-adjust the catheter for pressure monitor or feeding purposes. The catheter will stay in place for duration of mechanical ventilation. Confirmation of the esophageal catheter placement will be made when the patient obtains a daily chest x-ray for routine clinical care. There will be no additional radiation exposure for intubated patients that are participating in this study than those that are not participating in this study . The esophageal catheter will be connected to the Avea mechanical ventilator and all parts will be check to ensure they are properly functioning. In order to facilitate TPP measurements, patients will need to be well sedated. During routine nursing care, mechanically ventilated patients either receive continuous or bolus sedation medication. We will time the TPP measurements to be done after patient has received bolus sedation medication.\n\nBaseline ventilator settings will be collected. At patients' baseline ventilator settings, cardiac output (CO) will be measured using an ultrasound cardiac output monitor (USCOM). TPP measurements will be obtained at PEEP while performing an expiratory hold on the ventilator. TPP will then be obtained at PIP while performing and inspiratory hold on the ventilator. Once TPP measurements completed, PEEP will be adjusted by 2cm H2O increments to TPP. For every 2cm H2O adjustment on the ventilator, we will observe for patient tolerance of ventilator change for 2 minutes. If patients show any signs of intolerance (decrease SpO2 > 5%, increase in end tidal CO2 by more than 10 torr, heart rate >40 bpm from baseline, clinical respiratory distress), ventilator settings will be returned to baseline. Once PEEP has been adjusted to TPP, CO will be measured again using the USCOM. Measurements (CO, TPP at PEEP, TPP at PIP) will be done three times to ensure reproducibility and an average measurement of the three will be used for data description. TPP measurements will be done daily for up to 7 days. We will discontinue TPP measurements once patients are recovering and entering the weaning phase of mechanical ventilation (this is clinically determined by the primary care team in the PICU). The average length of mechanical ventilation for children in the PICU is 5-6 days, therefore an estimate of the number of TPP measurements will be 5-6 measurements.\n\nFor the later part of the study, when patients are consistently breathing spontaneously and have entered the weaning phase of ventilation, the same esophageal catheter used in the first part of the study will be used to measure pressure rate product as a surrogate for work of breathing while patients are trialed on minimal ventilator support. The esophageal catheter will be connected to the Bicore, a device that will monitor pulmonary measurements using the esophageal catheter to obtain pressure rate product measurements. The PRP will be measured with each decrease in setting of minimal ventilator support (starting from pressure support/PEEP of 10/5 cm H20 to 5/5 cm H20 to CPAP of 5cm H20). Patients will be placed on each setting for a 5 minute period and monitored for any signs of intolerance (decrease SpO2 > 5%, increase in end tidal CO2 by more than 10 torr, heart rate >40 bpm from baseline, clinical respiratory distress). Should patients not tolerate the decrease in settings of support, ventilator settings will be returned to baseline prior to changes made.\n\nAnalysis will be largely descriptive and provide information for the development of a transpulmonary pressure based protocol for ventilator management. Specifically, we will examine typical differences between PEEP set by clinicians, those recommended by available PEEP/FiO2 titration tables (ARDSNET 2000) and those recommended based on transpulmonary pressure, to determine whether there would be potential differences in choice of PEEP based on the method chosen. We will use the data to explore decision points for peak inspiratory pressure, again comparing differences between airway pressure and alveolar pressure, particularly as PEEP is changed. Finally, for aim 2, we seek to determine the potential decrease in number of days of mechanical ventilation if a minimum effort of breathing was used for the determination of extubation readiness. This will inform power calculations for future studies in which we may consider this endpoint, rather than actual extubation."

        "BriefSummary": [
          "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is the most common cause of death and long-term disability in children. Much of the long-term disability stems from neurocognitive impairments that are not greatly helped by current cognitive training and pharmacological treatments for TBI related cognitive impairments. This study tests the hypothesis that a drug, D-cycloserine (DCS), will significantly enhance the effect of cognitive training in correcting cognitive impairments in children with moderate/severe TBIs.\n\nIn order to do so, study subjects who fit inclusion criteria, including those with moderate to severe TBI who show persistent working memory weaknesses based on a screening, will be recruited. They will have three visits to UCLA. During the first visit, subjects will undergo an MRI protocol before and after taking a pill (drug or placebo, blinded). They will also participate in a number of paper and pencil cognitive tests. Then subjects will be enrolled in a 6 week computerized cognitive training program (CogMed). They will also be prescribed a drug/placebo pill (depending on which group they are randomized into), which they'll have to take at regular intervals during the 6 weeks. They will have weekly check in phone calls or visits by a coach trained in the program to make sure they are following the study protocol accurately, to have their questions answered, and for motivation. At the end of the training period, subjects will return to UCLA to again complete the MRI protocol and cognitive testing. After three months of enrollment, they will have a final visit to UCLA, including only cognitive testing. A total of 30 subjects will be entered into the study."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Study Design/Procedure: The proposed study uses a double blind, parallel, placebo control design to test the hypotheses that augmentation of suppressed NMDA receptor function following pediatric msTBI with D-cycloserine (DCS) will increase neural activation, and when used in conjunction with cognitive training will enhance the effect of cognitive training on working memory (WM). Participants who show WM weaknesses within 12 to 24 months post-injury will be randomly assigned to one of two arms in the proposed study. Weakness in WM is operationally defined as a working memory index (WMI) standard score below 90 or evidence of at least a 10-point discrepancy between IQ and WMI. Given the purpose of the study (improving working memory), there is little utility in including children who do no demonstrate weaknesses in WM. Participants in both treatment arms will complete baseline evaluations on the WM and executive functioning (EF) tests that assess generalization, and parents will complete questionnaires that assess WM and attentional functioning. (Note: participants who completed their 12-month RAPBI visit within three months of enrollment in the current project will complete only novel measures). All participants will then receive their first Cogmed training session. During this first visit, participants will be also complete our MRI protocol immediately before and two hours after the first dose of DCS or placebo to measure the acute physiological response to DCS. Both groups will then complete six weeks of Cogmed training and in addition either DCS or placebo. Cogmed training will be completed in the home, with the parent/guardian supervising completion. During the six weeks of training, both you and your child will speak with a coach once a week, who will guide your child through the program and help to monitor his/her progress. Participants will travel to UCLA half-way through their training to consult with one of the medical personnel regarding the medication and to note any side effects. At the end of the sixth week, participants will be retested on our MRI protocol and non-trained measures of WM and EF. Parents will complete the questionnaires that assess WM and attention. Three months after the termination of treatment, participants will again return to UCLA to complete one session of Cogmed training and will be retested on the non-trained measures of WM and EF. Their parents will complete questionnaires to assess the maintenance of training.\n\nIntercurrent events: Participants in the proposed project will be at least 12 months post-TBI. It is unlikely that new treatments will be initiated during the 4.5 months they are enrolled in the proposed project. Nevertheless we will monitor the medical and behavioral treatments outside of our study to ensure that they are not confounds.\n\nCogmed Training: Participants will perform the Cogmed WM training program via web-based software on a personal computer. If they do not have a personal computer, we will provide them with a laptop to borrow for the six weeks of training. Participants will train for 45 minutes per day, five days per week, for six weeks. Memory stimuli are presented in a computerized system in a total of eight visuospatial and verbal WM training exercises. Each training exercise consists of 15 trials. The exercises are in a video game format-with colorful graphics and crisp sound. In one spatial WM exercise the child remembers the sequence in which rows of lights turn on; in a verbal WM exercise the child recalls numbers in the reverse order in which they are given. The child uses a computer mouse to click the answers and earns points for performing well. The exercises train the child to attend to the screen and to visualize the location and remember the stimuli. For each of the eight WM training exercises difficulty is adjusted by changing the number of stimuli to be remembered. Training is performed close to the capacity of the individual by using an adaptive staircase method that adjusts difficulty on a trial-by-trial basis. At the end of each training day an Improvement index is calculated that measures improvement during the training period. The Improvement index is based on the person's results on three exercises.\n\nOn the first visit to UCLA, a coach will meet with the child and parent/guardian to teach them how to use the Cogmed program. The coach may encourage use a reward system to motivate and reinforce the child for training. The coach set up weekly times to contact the family. During these calls, the coach will review the child's progress, offer encouragement, and download performance data. The results of the improvement index will be shared with parents or adult participants, similar to how standardized paper and pencil neurocognitive test results are shared in clinical settings.\n\nDCS treatment: DCS can have opposing effects at low dose vs. high dose. In mouse cerebellar tissue there is an inverted U-shaped dose-response relationship. At low DCS concentrations, agonist activity may reflect binding to NMDA receptor (NMDAR) subunits. In contrast, at higher DCS concentrations antagonist effects may become prominent. Consistent with the above research, in both animal models and clinical applications, isolated low dose DCS treatments appear to have significant advantages over chronic treatment at higher doses. In animal models, a single dose of DCS reversed cognitive impairment produced by hippocampal lesions, anticholinergic agents, and early social deprivation. In healthy animals, a single dose of DCS enhanced extinction of conditioned fear performance on maze tasks, and visual recognition memory. Mice treated with a single, low-dose of DCS 24 or 72 hours after TBI exhibited significantly more rapid and complete recovery of motor and memory function compared with untreated controls. Tachyphylaxis rapidly develops with repeated dosing of DCS. A single dose of DCS administered within 30 minutes of extinction training increases 24 hour retention of fear extinction approximately 3-fold, whereas this effect was completely attenuated by 5 doses of DCS administered over 10 days preceding the extinction training.\n\nWe will use isolated, low doses of DCS in the proposed project. When used to treat psychiatric symptoms or cognitive impairments in children the typical dose is 50-100mg. A meta-analysis of the effect of DCS augmentation of fear extinction and exposure therapy did not find significant dose related effects across studies but in the one clinical study that systematically investigated doses, there was some evidence of greater efficacy with a higher dose. In the proposed study participants will receive 100 mg of DCS. The same meta-analysis found that the best effects were evident when DCS was administered either immediately before or after exposure training compared to a four hour delay. Animal models and human studies suggest that DCS does not affect performance during training; instead, it selectively improves memory consolidation for new learning typically assessed 24 hour after training. The acute physiological effects of DCS on brain activation, however, can be observed two hours after DCS administration on fMRI.\n\nIn the proposed study children will take a pill (DCS or placebo) every other day immediately prior to Cogmed training. Over six weeks of Cogmed training they will train 18 days after taking a pill and 12 days without taking a pill. This intermittent, isolated dosing should minimize tachyphylaxis and reduce the possibility that Cogmed training results in state dependent learning.\n\nDouble Blind: The UCLA pharmacy will fabricate identically appearing capsules for 100 mg of DCS and placebo. Only the research pharmacist will know whether a child is receiving DCS or Placebo. The child and parent, the Cogmed coach, research psychologists, and the clinicians monitoring side effects will not know what drug the child is receiving. If there are clinically significant side effects, the blind will be broken.\n\nSafety monitoring: Children in the DCS and placebo arms will be seen by Drs. Giza or Choe, who are pediatric neurologists, or their nurse practitioner three to four weeks after the initiation of treatment. In addition, the Cogmed coach will probe for side effects on each coaching call. Side effects will be assessed using a structured instrument and open-ended clinician inquiry. While there are scales for rating stimulant-related adverse events, we are not aware of a broadly accepted tool for glutamatergic agonists. Therefore, we will modify the Physical Symptom Checklist developed for the Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology, which includes a range of potential adverse events.\n\nMaximizing compliance/minimizing attrition: Weekly phone calls will be used to check on progress with Cogmed and assess motivation/compliance. As noted above, the coach may recommend use of a reward system to motivate and reinforce training. Any problems or issues will also be discussed during this call, with regards to both Cogmed and medication side effects. Participants will also meet with medical personnel during the third or fourth week of training to discuss possible side effects."

Three days per week, patients attend group-based treatment for two-and-a-half hours per day. The fourth day of each week consists of a one-hour group-based treatment, a one-hour family meeting, and a one-hour exposure session that includes children and their caregivers. One day per week, parents also attend a one-hour parent guidance group as part of the overall treatment package. Patients also have psychopharmacology consultations with the program psychiatrist on a case-by-case basis. On their first birthday that falls after the date of discharge, patients are sent a birthday card that includes a greeting and reminders about coping skills that they learned in the program.\n\nThe investigators expect to recruit at least 45 assenting/consenting patients in the first year of the study. The plan is to treat six-to-eight patients during each one-month module and to have a waitlist, if interest in the program exceeds the program's capacity. If a waitlist exists, patients, who are on this waitlist, will be evaluated as the study's control group once they are four weeks away from their target admission date.\n\nBefore the patient's first assessment through the program, an Independent Assessor will inform the patient and caregivers about the opportunity to participate in a voluntary research study at the McLean Anxiety Mastery Program. Assent/consent will be requested to utilize these data for research purposes. The patient and caregivers will be told that all of the information gathered from the semi-structured clinical interviews and self- and caregiver-report measures are part of routine clinical practice, and permission is being sought to use this de-identified data for research purposes. The patient and caregivers will be reminded that their decision to or not to participate in the research study will not affect the treatment they receive.\n\nThe assessments are conducted at the following time points: 1) Four weeks pre-admission (if there is a treatment waitlist), 2) upon admission, 3) weekly while the patients are participating in treatment, 4) upon discharge, and 5) at a three-month follow-up visit. If the program is not at capacity and therefore does not have a waitlist, patients will not be asked to postpone treatment for the sake of the waitlist control assessment and, instead, will be admitted directly into the program. Patients only will be included on the waitlist, if they are approximately four weeks from program admission. If the patient is fewer than four weeks from admission, the patient's first assessment will be upon admission.\n\nFamilies, who have assented/consented to participate in the research study, begin the assessment either while on the waitlist or upon admission to the program. The assessment process at each time point involves the same semi-structured interviews: the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS), the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) and the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS). The same questionnaire battery also is administered on the same day as the semi-structured interviews at each of these time points. The semi-structured interviews takes approximately two-to-four hours to complete, and the remainder of the battery, the self- and parent-report measures, takes approximately 15 minutes.\n\nTrained Independent Assessors conduct the interviews, and the self-report questionnaires are administered through REDCap Survey, a secure, HIPAA-compliant program for building and managing online surveys. The self-report measures are completed at secure computer terminals on-site at the program. If families are unable to travel to the program to complete surveys while on the waitlist or at follow-up, the Independent Assessors will use REDCap Survey to send two survey links (i.e., a parent survey and a child survey) to the caregiver and child. If a patient or family member does not complete the online survey within 48 hours, an Independent Assessor will contact them with a reminder one time via phone or e-mail. The survey does not include questions assessing risk (e.g., for suicidal ideation, self-harm, substance use)."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a complication of type 1, or \"insulin-dependent,\" diabetes (T1DM) and is defined by a high blood glucose level (over 200 mg/dL) coupled with severe acidosis. Children with T1DM lack adequate insulin production. Without insulin, glucose cannot be used by cells to produce energy and blood glucose levels increase. As a result, the body breaks down fat tissue for adequate energy production. This results in ketone and acid production, and ultimately DKA. Often times DKA is present at the time of diabetes diagnosis. Recent estimates suggest that nearly 30% of children that present with DKA are newly diagnosed with diabetes. DKA can also occur as a result of poorly controlled T1DM or poor adherence to insulin therapy. It is common for such patients to have recurrent episodes of DKA, which may lead to permanent brain injury.\n\nCerebral edema (CE), or \"brain swelling,\" can also occur with severe DKA. It is unclear what causes CE in children with DKA. Proposed mechanisms include changes in blood flow to the brain, inflammatory mediation, and alteration in the intracellular and extracellular fluid composition in the brain. CE can be \"clinically apparent\" or \"subclinical\" in terms of symptomatology. Children with clinically apparent DKA-related CE present with neurologic deficits and altered mental status. These children are at risk for herniation of the brain stem due to elevated pressures in and around the brain, and ultimately death. The neurologic manifestations of clinically apparent DKA-related CE typically occur 4-12 hours after the initiation of medical therapy. However, cases have been reported to occur prior to initiation of therapy. Although clinically apparent DKA-related CE is rare, occurring in 0.5-1% of children with DKA, subclinical DKA-related CE is much more common with estimates suggesting that up to 54% of children with DKA have underlying CE that goes clinically undetected. Early identification of both clinically apparent and subclinical DKA-related CE is critical as the time between initial neurologic symptoms and clinical deterioration can be as little as 3 hours. Moreover, early identification of subclinical DKA-related CE may lead to differences in medical therapy.\n\nCurrent evaluation for DKA-related CE necessitates a high index of clinical suspicion and often times such patients receive advanced brain imaging such as computed tomography (CT) scans. While CT scans can identify CE, this imaging modality exposes patients to ionizing radiation, is expensive, and may take considerable time in some instances. Moreover, CE can occur in the absence of acute change on CT and some patients with subclinical CE may go unidentified. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to identify subclinical DKA-related CE, however this is often time-consuming, expensive, requires sedation, or may be unavailable at some centers. Ocular sonography (ultrasound) is an alternative imaging technique that can provide immediate diagnostic capability at the bedside and minimize radiation exposure. This technique has been used to rapidly and accurately detect increased brain swelling through measurement of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) in a number of clinical situations including pediatric head trauma, hydrocephalus and ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunctions, and altitude sickness in adults.\n\nIt is believed, no study has used ocular ultrasound to examine the ONSD in the setting of diabetes or DKA for identification of clinically apparent or subclinical CE. It is unclear if patients with T1DM have a fundamentally different baseline ONSD measurement compared to described normal values. It is also unclear how the ONSD varies during times of diabetes-related illness, such as high blood glucose levels without criteria for DKA compared to unequivocal DKA.\n\nInvestigators plan to conduct a prospective study including children aged 7-18 years that present to the Children's Endocrinology Clinic and Children's Emergency Department. The objective of this study is to assess the utility of sonographic measurements of the ONSD as a tool for identification of DKA-related CE. Specifically, the primary aim of this study is to measure and compare the mean ONSD in children with well-controlled T1DM to those presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with DKA and to those presenting to the ED with T1DM and hyperglycemia without criteria for DKA. Investigators hypothesize that the mean ONSD measurement is smaller in children with well-controlled T1DM compared to children presenting to the ED with DKA and compared to children with T1DM and hyperglycemia without criteria for DKA. Secondarily, investigators aim to compare the mean ONSD in children presenting to the ED with DKA to those presenting to the ED with T1DM and hyperglycemia without criteria for DKA. The study team hypothesizes that the mean ONSD measurement is larger in children presenting to the ED with DKA compared children presenting with T1DM and hyperglycemia without criteria for DKA."

The investigators focus on patient centered outcomes as described by the families of MRSA infected patients. Such outcomes are likely to include quality of life, side effects, and school and work attendance. The hypothesis is that treatment with decolonization will decrease the rate of SSTI recurrence and improve overall patient centered outcomes. The rationale is that negative outcomes such as recurrence may be avoided through the use of readily available prevention strategies, but that it is important to determine how burdensome those prevention strategies are for patients and families."

These responses will be used to shape activities during this or future programs for teens.

Go Girls! is a new dance-based patient fitness support group being offered via the Pediatric Endocrinology division in conjunction with the Center for Research in Reproduction and the Children's Fitness Clinic for girls at-risk for weight-related medical complications, particularly those with excess weight, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), diabetes mellitus, or insulin resistance. The goals of the program are to introduce girls to exercise in a fun, non-threatening environment, meet other girls with similar health concerns, enable girls to discover and develop a personal enjoyment of exercise, and enable low-pressure interactions with medical care providers. The primary aim of this study is to determine changes in girls' enjoyment of exercise. Our hypothesis is that introducing girls to a fun, non-threatening environment of exercise with peer support will modify scores on a physical activity enjoyment scale. Secondary aims will assess for changes in weekly exercise, attitudes about exercise, and metabolic parameters and evidence for androgen (male hormone) excess (a precursor to PCOS). Subjects will be recruited from girls already participating in the Go Girls! program. Go Girls! is open to girls ages 10-18 yr with diagnoses of abnormal weight gain, excess weight, insulin resistance, PCOS, premature adrenarche, or type 2 diabetes mellitus previously cared for by the Pediatric Endocrinology or Children's Fitness Clinics. Questionnaire, anthropometric, and optional fasting biochemical information will be collected from girls at the beginning (first month), middle (third month), and end of a 6-month exercise/support group intervention. Assessment of the primary aim will be by comparing scores on the validated Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) compared before, during and after the intervention. Secondary aims will be assessed via self-reported estimates of weekly exercise, qualitative written assessments of attitudes towards exercise, and changes in biochemical data. Data obtained from the questionnaire will be used to assess the primary aim of this protocol. The biochemical information, obtained via optional blood draws at the beginning, middle, and end of the 6-month exercise/support group intervention will be used to address one of the secondary aims. These blood draws are optional so as not to deter subjects from participating in the main part of the study. Data from the questionnaire and anthropometric measurements will be useful for testing the primary and some of the secondary aims of this study, regardless of whether or not fasting biochemical information is obtained."

          "Low blood sugars are known to cause brain damage in newborn babies. One of the most common causes of low blood sugars persisting beyond the new born period is a condition called congenital hyperinsulinism (HI). This is a disease whereby the pancreas secretes too much insulin and causes low blood sugars. Twenty to forty percent of these babies will have brain damage. There are two forms of this disease. In one form only a small part of the pancreas makes too much insulin (focal HI) and in the other, the whole pancreas make too much insulin (diffuse HI). Another very similar disease is insulinoma which occurs after birth, but also causes hyperinsulinism. If a surgeon could know which part of the pancreas has the focal lesion he could remove it and cure the patient.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate whether a new investigational drug called Fluorodopa F 18, when used with a PET scan, can find the focal lesion and guide the surgeon to remove it, thus curing the patient and preventing further brain damage."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Congenital Hyperinsulinism (HI) is a disorder of insulin secretion that causes profound hypoglycemia leading to significant morbidity. It is the most common form of persistent neonatal hypoglycemia, and the most dangerous. Inappropriate insulin secretion causes not only hypoglycemia but also inability to release free fatty acids from adipose tissue and inability to release glycogen from the liver. Hence the brain is deprived of all the major fuel sources (glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate and lactate) for energy thus leading to the high incidence of brain damage. In up to 50% of cases of congenital hyperinsulinism, medical therapy fails and surgical resection of the pancreas is necessary. Previous techniques developed to differentiate those patients with focal HI in whom surgery could result in a cure are very invasive and put the infants at risk for hypoglycemic brain damage or arterial thrombosis.\n\nIt is known that the beta cells in the pancreatic islets, similar to other neuroendocrine tissues, contain amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). Beta cells take up L-Dopa and convert it into dopamine by AADC. It was proposed that as other neuroendocrine tumors such as phaeochromocytoma and carcinoid tumors express AADC and can be very easily visualized using Fluorodopa F 18 PET then so also would the pancreas be easily and accurately visualized. After initial reports demonstrated the effectiveness, safety and accuracy, there have been now over 200 patients with HI reported in the literature who have had Fluorodopa F 18 PET scans with suggestions that referral to major HI centers for Fluorodopa F 18 PET CT is now an integral part of standard of care management of patients with HI that require surgery. Fluorodopa F 18 PET scanning for patients with Hyperinsulinism is now established in Europe and Australia, and has close to 95% sensitivity. When linked to Computed Tomography (CT) image of the pancreas, Fluorodopa F 18 PET allows the surgeon to image the pancreas in three dimensions, to even more accurately identify the site of the focal lesion, increasing the chance of a sufficient partial pancreatectomy to cure the patient.\n\nSimilarly, insulinomas are neuroendocrine cell tumors that are typically benign (90%) and very rare occurring in 1-4 per million of the population with > 50% occurring in adults >age 25 years. Biochemical differentiation of insulinomas from congenital hyperinsulinism may be aided by the use of the pro-insulin:insulin ratio, by the age of presentation and by the history. The standard of care for insulinoma is to remove them once identified, rather than long term medical treatment. Current imaging techniques include CT scan pancreas, endoscopic ultrasound of the pancreas and MRI pancreas however despite using these modalities in some patients the insulinoma may not be found. 18F-DOPA has been shown to be superior than MIBG scanning for neuroendocrine tumors such as phaeochromocytoma, but there is very little data in patients with insulinoma. Moreover, patients with MEN 1 and insulinoma may have more than one tumor, which if missed with conventional imaging could result in failure to cure with surgery.\n\nThe objectives of this study are:\n\nTo determine, using Positron Emission Tomography, whether or not the uptake of a radiopharmaceutical agent, Fluorodopa 18F (18F-DOPA) produced in a cyclotron located at a distance far from the imaging center will produce qualitatively adequate pancreatic images in patients with congenital hyperinsulinism\nTo determine, using direct comparisons, whether or not Fluorodopa 18F Positron Emission Tomography (18F-DOPA PET) combined with Computed Tomography (CT) will produce pancreatic images matching the gold-standard of histopathological findings at surgery for partial or complete pancreatectomy in the treatment of patients with congenital hyperinsulinism\nTo determine, using direct comparisons, whether or not Fluorodopa 18F Positron Emission Tomography (18F-DOPA PET) combined with Computed Tomography (CT) will produce pancreatic images matching the gold-standard of histopathological findings at surgery for insulinomas\nTo determine the best way to interpret the 18F-DOPA PET scans comparing SUV max:SUV sub max at a ratio of the current 1.5, a suggested 1.3 and by using visual inspection of the images."

Participants in the control group will receive a cartoon on the TV monitor in the patient room, while participants in the study group will receive a more immersive distraction of playing a game or watching a cartoon (for children too young to play a game) on a tablet computer. Data from this study will help inform best practices for administering painful procedures in a way that minimizes pain."

          "Project: Application of a Severe Sepsis Electronic Health Record Integrated Screening Tool and Management Bundle (eASSIST-M) Study\n\nStudy Type: Prospective Cohort Outcomes Study\n\nBackground: Early recognition of severe sepsis is critical for the institution of goal- directed therapy and for improving patient outcomes. Barriers to early recognition include the lack of standardized tools to identify children with severe sepsis. The investigators will study the potential impact of applying a novel Pediatric Severe Sepsis Screening Tool (PSSST) integrated with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) to facilitate earlier detection and effective management of severe sepsis.\n\nPopulation: Patients between the ages 1 month and 18 years admitted to the hospital or presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with clinical signs of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS).\n\nPrimary Hypothesis: Prospective application of a PSSST electronically integrated with the EHR can accurately diagnose pediatric patients with early signs of severe sepsis.\n\nPrimary Outcome Measure: Proportion of correctly diagnosed patients with severe sepsis among those presenting with SIRS will be assessed to prospectively validate the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the PSSST tool.\n\nSecondary Hypothesis 1: Application of the PSSST will reduce lag-time for the administration of a goal-directed sepsis therapy bundle by 50%.\n\nOutcome Measure: Time delay from diagnostic identification to critical therapeutic intervention. Sepsis Recognition Lag Time will be defined as the time elapsed from the first electronic alert to the first therapeutic intervention. Therapeutic interventions will be defined as Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), fluid resuscitation, initiation of cardiotonic agents, or request for transfer to the ICU. Since this is an intent-to-diagnose study, outcomes defined above will be compared with those for the same period in the preceding year.\n\nSecondary Hypothesis 2: Application of a severe sepsis management bundle will reduce mortality and morbidity.\n\nOutcome Measure: Proportion of deaths in the study population due to severe sepsis. Morbidity will be defined as the number of ventilator days, days on vasopressor or inotropic agents, days of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) support, need for tracheostomy, need for Gastrostomy tube.\n\nProposed Study Design:\n\nThe investigators will conduct a prospective study where patients within the ED and inpatient units are electronically screened using the PSSST during a 3-year study period. Patients will be screened using a novel electronic tracking tool designed locally, using pre-defined severe sepsis variables and validated on patients with severe sepsis. Patients screened as positive for severe sepsis using the electronic tracking tool will be treated prospectively with a standardized severe sepsis management bundle. Data will be collected prospectively on all patients admitted to the ED and inpatient units. For the ED and each inpatient unit, the outcomes defined above will be compared with those for the same period in the preceding year.\n\nCovariates: Demographic, clinical characteristics and sepsis-specific factors that could potentially influence the effect of the alerts on critical intervention.\n\nStatistical Analysis:\n\nTo assess the effectiveness of this tool, we will compare the proportions of the population with each variable of interest between the intervention and prior periods.\n\nTo assess the efficacy of the PSSST, we will compare the changes over time in the proportion of patients diagnosed severe sepsis adjusting for key covariates of interest.\nTo assess the effectiveness of the PSSST in reducing treatment delays, we will compare changes in the Sepsis Recognition Lag Time between the intervention and control periods, while adjusting for key covariates of interest.\nTo assess the efficacy of the PSSST in reducing mortality, we will compare the changes in the age and risk adjusted mortality rates over time between the intervention and control periods.\n\nThe investigators will use a robust variance estimate for all analyses to account for the clustering of patients within units. We will also use propensity scores to control for differences in patient characteristics and diagnostic categories."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Infantile-onset Pompe disease is an inherited disorder caused by lack of or defect in the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). GAA enzyme deficiency causes glycogen to build up and damage cells throughout the body, especially in the heart and muscles, which is normally diagnosed within the first months of life. Current treatment for Pompe disease involves enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using the drug alglucosidase alfa (Lumizyme/Myozyme), which provides a form of the GAA enzyme to replace the enzyme that is missing or not working properly in the patient's blood.\n\nIn this study, the investigators will learn about the patient's ability to tolerate ERT. Cross-Reactive Immunological Material (CRIM) is a measurement of natural GAA production and an important factor that affects how patients respond to ERT with Myozyme. Children who produce some natural GAA are classified as CRIM positive (+), while children who do not produce any natural GAA are classified as CRIM negative (-). Children who are CRIM+ generally tolerate ERT well. But, children who are CRIM-, and some children classified as CRIM+, have a poor response to ERT due to complications from an immune response against the drug. Treatments are currently being developed to stop this immune response and prevent complications from ERT.\n\nThis is a longitudinal natural history study of Infantile Pompe disease.

Several characteristics contribute to its widespread use, including its noninvasive nature, reliability and safety. The Somanetics' INVOS® System harnesses this power to safely and reliably \"see inside\" the brain and body. NIRS devices measure the venous weighted oxy-hemoglobin saturation (color of blue blood) in a field of tissue, rather than in arteries, and thus the rSO2 parameter provides a window into regional oxygen supply-demand relationships. Monitoring rSO2 at two distinct sites (cerebral and somatic) has become common practice at our institution for all infants and children in the intensive care unit and provides valuable feedback about potentially deleterious trends in regional tissue oxygenation that cannot easily be obtained by other modalities in such patients."

Routine developmental screening and early intervention have been suggested as strategies to identify and ameliorate these problems. The purpose of this study is to describe the developmental trajectory and psychosocial functioning of children referred to the Herma Heart Center Developmental Follow-Up Program for routine developmental assessment.\n\nThe specific aims of this project are:\n\nto summarize the results of developmental screening, quality of life, and family impact in subjects that have been evaluated in the HHC Developmental Follow-Up Program since its inception in 2007,\nto evaluate longitudinal changes in the trajectory of development for subjects that undergo repeated developmental and psychosocial screening,\nto characterize how subjects with congenital heart disease compare to normative data for the instruments utilized and samples of children with other chronic health conditions, and\nto determine what factors predict variability in developmental outcomes i.e. demographic and clinical variables such as gender, race, socioeconomic status, diagnosis, type of surgery, and length of hospitalization among others.\n\nBecause our research and the research of others have indicated that children with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) are at higher risk for neurodevelopmental and psychosocial problems, the Herma Heart Center Developmental Follow-Up Program was created in 2007. All infants who have open-heart surgery within the first 30 days of life, and all children under the age of 3 years who have a cyanotic lesion are referred to the clinic.\n\nThis study will utilize both retrospective chart review and prospective collection of data from new subjects entering the program.\n\nNo additional procedures are required to participate in the research study. Participation in the research study involves granting permission for the research team to systematically analyze the data obtained during the HHC Developmental Follow-Up Program clinic visits that a child participates in and to aggregate these data with all subjects that have received these follow-up assessments.\n\nA sample size of 1000 subjects is needed to ensure adequate power to detect medium effect sizes for the multiple outcome measures that are proposed (assuming p = .05 and power = .80). Therefore, recruitment for the study will continue until a sample size of 1000 subjects is reached. Estimated recruitment duration is 7 years.\n\nThere are no anticipated risks related to participation in this study.\n\nDescriptive analyses will be conducted to summarize characteristics of the sample and to determine the frequency of developmental/behavioral/emotional problems among children in the present sample. Correlation and regression analyses will be conducted to examine the relationships among demographic, clinical, and outcome variables. For children with multiple visits, longitudinal changes and the pattern of developmental trajectory for children with congenital heart disease will be examined.\n\nResults may point to possible areas for intervention to improve child and family psychosocial outcomes."

          "Emergency department (ED) visits have increased by 25% over the past decade. 85% of these patients are discharged, and the standard of care is to provide each patient/caregiver with written instructions that highlight how to care for a particular illness at home and signs to return to the hospital. Compliance with such ED discharge instructions is limited, leading to suboptimal medical care and unnecessary return visits to the ED. Inadequate health literacy, language disparities, and poor comprehension of written discharge information contribute to this problem. This health gap is more prevalent in children of young parents, low-income families, and minority populations where a disproportionate number of patients visit the ED for non-emergent care, often because of a lack of health education. The ED environment is chaotic and distracting and suboptimal to educate patients. Such education is best accomplished where aftercare occurs-in the home, but many patients lack direction and motivation to seek reliable sources of focused health education.\n\nhealthEworks LLC has developed Video Prescriptions™ - concise 3-5 minute video modules specific to the most common discharge diagnoses that patients receive in the ED. Further work is needed to develop a professional, diagnosis-specific product. These videos will feature Dr. Christina Johns, an emergency physician who specializes in delivering health information on camera. Each video will be interactive, high definition, designed for small screen size, such as for a smartphone or laptop computer. Each video prescription™ will highlight the transition from hospital to home and focuses on what the diagnosis means, how to treat it at home, and which signs should prompt the patient to return to the ED or seek urgent care. A HIPAA-compliant tablet-based platform will link ED patients with their personalized video education, establishing an innovative system of post-discharge information sharing.\n\nThe use of video prescriptions™ will improve patient health education for the 100 million patients who are discharged from U.S. ED's annually. This technology is particularly applicable for hospitals that face increasing pressures to provide performance measures for hospital discharge.\n\nVideo prescriptions™ will be utilized by ED patients, regardless of socioeconomic status, will improve patient satisfaction and reduce unnecessary ED return visits.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: Demonstrate patient utilization of video prescriptions Criteria for acceptance: a hyperlink click rate of greater than 70%\nSpecific Aim 2: Demonstrate improved health outcomes. Criteria for acceptance: a reduction in return visits by 10%\nSpecific Aim 3: Demonstrate quality of video content by showing improved patient satisfaction scores. Criteria for acceptance: improvement in patient satisfaction scores by 20%"

        "BriefSummary": [
          "Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is an FDA approved mode of mechanical ventilation. This mode of ventilation is currently in routine use in adult, pediatric and neonatal intensive care units. The electrical activity of the diaphragm, the largest muscle used during inspiration, is measured. The ventilator triggers (synchronizes patient effort) and applies proportional assistance based on measured electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi). This electrical activity is measured through a feeding tube that also has a multiple-array esophageal electrode in it. This mode of ventilation has been proven to be equivalent to pressure support ventilation (PSV). Theoretically, the breath-to-breath control offered by NAVA may not only trigger faster and synchronize better, but provide the support deemed appropriate by the central nervous center on demand. Traditionally in the intensive care unit (ICU), pressure support is applied to subject breathing spontaneously. Pressure is set to achieve a given tidal volume. The influence of changing lung compliance not only from the lung disease itself, but the interactions of the respiratory muscles can drastically change minute ventilation and contribute to hyper- or hypoventilation. These changes are typically found on assessment of end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2), blood gas, or oxygen saturation (SpO2) monitoring; all of which are potentially preventable if we allowed the central nervous system to control the ventilator. NAVA may allow us to couple the central nervous system (neuro-coupling) with the ventilator to provide real-time proportional assistance, reduce work of breathing and apply physiologic breathing patterns."

It also results in elevated androgen levels such as testosterone. In women with PCOS, the majority of excess androgens are produced by the ovaries. However, it is unknown whether the ovaries are fully active during early puberty. The purpose of this study is to determine how the ovaries contribute to the production of male hormones in the body during different stages of puberty, so that it can be better understood why some females have excess androgens."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Adolescent hyperandrogenemia can represent a forerunner to adult PCOS. Because adrenarche leads to an increase in adrenal androgen production during early puberty and since early puberty is associated with an overnight rise in testosterone that follows a similar time course to cortisol, we hypothesize that the adrenal gland is a major source of androgens in early puberty. On the other hand, the overnight rise in testosterone may reflect an ovarian response to overnight increases of gonadotropin secretion in early puberty. However, the ability of the ovaries to produce androgens (e.g., to respond to gonadotropin stimulation) during early puberty has not been tested concurrently in these girls. The sources of excess androgen production and the timing of their relative contributions across puberty are important in understanding the mechanism of hyperandrogenemia in these individuals. In addition, determination of the sources of hyperandrogenemia across puberty may have clinical utility in the development of preclinical screening tests designed to reveal those girls at greatest risk for PCOS and identification of potential therapeutic targets to prevent its development."

Some girls with high levels of male hormone will develop normal hormone levels as they grow up, but most girls continue to have high levels of male hormone as adults. The purpose of this study is to understand where the male and female hormones come from in girls as they get older. The investigators think the adrenal gland, makes most of the hormones in young girls and that the ovary and the adrenal gland make these hormones in older girls. The investigators would like to find out whether an overactive adrenal gland makes these hormones higher in girls who are overweight, compared to those who are not overweight."

          "We propose that the adrenal gland is the predominant source of the early morning rise in progesterone and testosterone which is more marked in early puberty. Specifically, we hypothesize that dexamethasone administration at 22:00 will be associated with a dampened progesterone and testosterone rise the subsequent morning in normal girls. We also propose that the adrenal gland is the source of the excess androgen production in young obese girls, and that dexamethasone will decrease their early morning testosterone and progesterone levels. We will explore the hypothesis that functional adrenal hyperandrogenism, or ACTH hyperresponsiveness, is one mechanism underlying this excess adrenal androgen production seen in obesity."

          "The discovery that the vitamin D receptor is expressed in more than 30 tissues indicates that the physiologic functions of vitamin D are much broader than its well-known role in the regulation of calcium absorption and bone metabolism. There is evidence that vitamin D is involved in the pathogenesis of cancer, cardiovascular disease, multiple sclerosis, and type I diabetes. Recent epidemiological evidence points to a strong association between vitamin D insufficiency and insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome, and type II diabetes. The investigators would like to examine the role of vitamin D in the development of insulin resistance in overweight children and adolescents, which represent a high risk population for cardiovascular and metabolic complications. The investigators propose a prospective randomized clinical trial of vitamin D supplementation in overweight, insulin resistant, vitamin D deficient children. The investigators objective is to assess if changes in insulin resistance, fasting lipid profiles, blood pressure, and inflammatory markers occur in these patients post treatment with vitamin D. Additionally, concomitant changes in calcium and bone metabolism after vitamin D treatment will be evaluated. This is because, contrary to adults, the optimal vitamin D concentrations that regulate calcium and bone metabolism have not been established in pediatrics."

          "When to start children with Fabry disease on therapy is controversial because of its expense and inconvenience. Many Fabry children complain of exercise intolerance. In adults, the investigators have found decreased lung function and ability to exercise on a treadmill. Whether or not lung function and exercise capacity is abnormal in children is unknown. While lung function and exercise tests are commonly part of routine evaluations for adults with Fabry, they are not yet for children.\n\nThe objective of the proposed study is to more accurately define the lung and exercise abnormalities in a group of 20 boys from 8-18 years of age with Fabry disease who have not been treated with enzyme replacement therapy (Fabrazyme)."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Fabry disease is due to an alteration in the genetic material (DNA) that causes a deficiency of the alpha-galactosidase A enzyme. This enzyme aids in the breakdown and elimination of certain types of fatty substances called glycolipids. These glycolipids are normally present within the body in most cells. When alpha-galactosidase A is lacking, these glycolipids build up in various tissues such as the eye, liver, kidney, skin, muscle, heart, and blood vessels. The build up of glycolipid levels in these tissues, particularly globotriaosylceramide (GL-3), is thought to cause the clinical symptoms that are associated with Fabry disease. Fabry disease causes chronic kidney damage leading to a need for dialysis or kidney transplantation, chronic heart damage leading to abnormal heart rhythms and heart attacks and strokes at an early age, nervous system damage leading to chronic pain, and a premature death. Because the gene for Fabry is on the X chromosome (men have only one X chromosome while women have two), most patients with symptoms of Fabry are men but many women have symptoms that may be as severe as men. There is currently a FDA approved treatment available that treats many of the symptoms of Fabry, but it involves intravenous infusions every other week and is very expensive.\n\nWhen to start children on therapy is controversial because of its expense and inconvenience. Children with significant pain or gastrointestinal problems are started on therapy immediately, otherwise not until they are at least teenagers. Increasing evidence suggests that even without overt symptoms, significant, irreversible damage may be occurring in childhood. However, determining whether such damage is present or not requires biopsies. There are no simple measures of disease severity.\n\nMany Fabry children complain of exercise intolerance. In adults, the investigators have found decreased lung function and ability to exercise on a treadmill. Whether or not lung function and exercise capacity is abnormal in children is unknown. While lung function and exercise tests are commonly part of routine evaluations for adults with Fabry, they are not yet for children.\n\nThe objective of the proposed study is to more accurately define the lung and exercise abnormalities in a group of 20 boys from 8-18 years of age with Fabry disease who have not been treated with enzyme replacement therapy (Fabrazyme). This will be done by several breathing tests and exercising on a treadmill. If the breathing tests are abnormal, then testing would serve as an easy way to evaluate children and help decide when therapy should be started and monitor the effectiveness of therapy.\n\nEach person that consents to participate in the study will be required to commit to a single study visit that will last approximately 4 hours at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The participant will be expected to wear loose fit clothing and comfortable athletic footwear.\n\nAs part of the research, participants will be asked to participate in the following tests:\n\nA pulmonary function test\nExercise test. Results will be forwarded to each participant's primary care physician.\n\nAll subjects must have previously been enrolled in the Fabry Registry and have the recommended standard of care assessments in order to be eligible for this pilot study."

They are common pediatric emergency department procedures that frequently require repeated attempts or are only partially successful, with sufficient blood to limit interpretation. Measuring cerebrospinal fluid pressure during lumbar punctures is recommended but rarely done, due to limitations of current technology. Liquid column manometry is cumbersome, time-consuming and frequently impractical. Existing pressure transduction probes that connect via tubing to external monitors are not designed or recommended for lumbar punctures. The pressure is displayed on a monitor that is difficult to view during the LP procedure and they equilibrate too slowly to keep pace of pressure changes during LPs. The Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced is a new, inexpensive, disposable, medical device, specifically designed for use during LPs, that has the potential to increase lumbar punctures success and decrease blood contamination. It attaches to the spinal needle and displays both a numeric pressure value and a pressure waveform, allowing physicians to more readily identify the cerebrospinal fluid space and measure cerebrospinal fluid pressure. The device is small, easy to use, and readily incorporated into standard practice.\n\nThe Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced uniquely provides immediate feedback about pressure that may allow physicians to more quickly and confidently identify the CSF space, and instantly determine cerebrospinal fluid pressure when the space is reached. The investigators believe the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced will increase lumbar punctures success and decrease the proportion containing blood. It has the potential to become the standard of care and be used in every lumbar puncture procedure. This study is expected to demonstrate the clinical utility of the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced to the medical community. Increased awareness of the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced and a positive demonstration of the viability of the technology will help attract either the investment capital or the strategic partnership necessary to fully develop the market."

We will test the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced against standard care in 60 children receiving lumbar puncture, comparing success, pressures obtaining, time to success, complications (e.g. >200 red blood cells/mm3) and provider satisfaction. Results will be compared with chi-squared tests, regressions, Kaplan-Meier and logrank tests. We expect improved success, decreased time to success and complications and high provider satisfaction.\n\nImpact: Currently, one third of lumbar punctures require multiple attempts, 7-20% contain blood that limits interpretation, and 6% are unsuccessful. This results in unnecessary hospitalizations, increased hospital days, increased antibiotic use and increased numbers of repeat procedures. The Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced uniquely provides immediate feedback about pressure that will allow physicians to more quickly and confidently identify the cerebrospinal fluid space, and instantly determine cerebrospinal fluid pressure when the space is reached.

          "Psoriasis was initially considered an inflammatory condition primarily of the skin. However, advances in medical knowledge have allowed insight into the wide-ranging systemic effects of long-term uncontrolled inflammation, thus shifting the concept of psoriasis from an inflammatory disease restricted to the skin to a systemic process. Adults w/ psoriasis have higher rates of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and smoking and the prevalence of each risk factor increases as the extent of psoriasis increases.1 It is uncertain if any of this relates to a behavioral reaction to having psoriasis or as a separate part of the disease process. Inflammation has a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease most noted by multiple observational studies of psoriasis patients which demonstrate an increased risk of arterial or venous events, notably myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events, pulmonary emboli, cardiovascular death or mortality overall. Specifically, Gelfand et. al. show an increased relative risk for myocardial infarction and an increased hazard ratio for mortality in patients with severe psoriasis, but most notably, show highest risk in younger adult patients. There is a paucity of data on risks with psoriasis in the pediatric and adolescent age group."

          "During bypass, venous drainage is essential for maintaining proper perfusion of a pediatric patient. The quality of venous drainage has a large impact on the level of care the patient is provided. This study will investigate blood flow velocities through right angle venous cannulae which are utilized during bypass. The flows from each cannulae will be analyzed by using doppler flow probes which employ Transit Time Technology. This type of technology has crystals within the flow probes which send magnetic signals through the tubing with the purpose to determine the most accurate flows of blood. There is little evidence that identifies the actual amount of blood flow generated from each venous cannulae in a clinical setting. Manufacturers of venous cannulae for CPB publish flow ratings for the different sized cannulae available. These flow ratings are gathered from data produced in a non-clinical lab and are often very inaccurate. Because of this inaccuracy, selection is based on experience rather than published clinical data. This study would be instrumental in determining any and all potential risks or benefits to the patient as a result of the amount of drainage provided by the venous cannulae during bypass. A sample size of 50 patients (n=50) over one day old will be utilized for this study. The specific venous cannulae sizes that will be analyzed are the 12Fr, 14Fr, 16Fr, 18Fr, 20Fr, 24Fr, & 28Fr DLP (DLP and Fr are the type and size of cannulae, respectively) right angle cannulae. The doppler flow probes that will be utilized during this study are reusable, non-invasive, clamp-on devices which measure blood flow through the CPB tubing. Each patient will have one flow probe placed on each venous cannulae prior to starting CPB. Bypass itself will not be altered in anyway. Hemoglobin blood levels, blood temperature, and pressure from the venous line will be recorded throughout CPB and are digitally sampled via the CPB machine (e.g. no blood draw required). To further examine the quality of venous drainage, a pressure transducer will be attached to the venous line measuring the amount of negative pressure being generated by the venous cannulae. The negative pressure line will be attached to the venous line at a stopcock that is already present in our CPB circuit. Each cannulae size will be analyzed three times to acquire the proper amount of data needed to fulfill the statistical and practical needs for the study. A descriptive analysis of the continuous and categorical data will be performed using means, standard deviations, confidence intervals, proportions, and frequency distributions. Statistical testing will include parametric and non-parametric bi-variate and multi-variate techniques as appropriate to the variables' level of measurement and distributions."

          "Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is a FDA approved mode of mechanical ventilation. This mode of ventilation is currently in routine use in adult, pediatric and neonatal intensive care units. The electrical activity of the diaphragm, the largest muscle used during respiration, is measured. The ventilator applies support in proportion to the measured electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi). This electrical activity is measured through a feeding tube that also has a multiple-array esophageal electrode in it.\n\nWhenever a patient gets extubated in our MSICU, we conduct a routine extubation readiness test. This is standard of care in our ICU. If the patient fails this test, the patient stays on the ventilator. If he passes, he gets extubated. We wish to conduct a study during which we will monitor the electrical activity of the diaphragm during this test. If the patient passes the extubation readiness test, the study is complete. If he fails, he resumes on the ventilator. In our study, we would then use the measured signal of the diaphragm to guide the ventilator. This mode of ventilation is called NAVA. We do not currently use this mode of ventilation in the ICU, but could do so since it is FDA approved. However, we wish to use this protocol to gain more expertise with this mode of ventilation in the ICU in a controlled fashion. We wish to enroll 20 pediatric patients. Patients in the ICU are routinely on a variety of different models of ventilators. Usually, the respiratory therapist determines which ventilator will be used. All patients in this study would be on the Servo-I ventilator, which is an FDA approved ventilator and capable of monitoring electrical activity of the diaphragm and currently used in our MSICU."

          "Specific Aims /Objectives Specific Aim 1: To determine if Edi is a predictor of extubation readiness. (Hypothesis: an increase of 20-50% in Edi from baseline (prior to ERT) will predict successful extubation.) Specific Aim 2: If the patient fails the ERT - We hope to determine if NAVA will provide more information about why the patient failed the ERT. (Hypothesis: a decrease in peak inspiratory pressure from baseline (post ERT failure) is predictive of high frequency diaphragm fatigue and subsequent successful ERT.\n\nBackground and Significance The diaphragmatic function plays a pivotal role in the patient's ability to breathe on a ventilator, and on the successfulness of weaning from a ventilator and extubation. However, diaphragmatic function is not routinely measured in the ICU, which we would like to do in this trial.\n\nWhen the mechanical load of the respiratory system is too large or continues for a long period of time, the diaphragm can develop contractile fatigue[1]. This fatigue can be short or long term. Short term is also known as high-frequency fatigue that results from the accumulation of inorganic phosphate[2][3], and to a lesser extent intramuscular acidosis[4]. On the other hand long term fatigue, otherwise known as low-frequency fatigue is consistent with muscle injury[5, 6] and can persist for days. Being able to identify what type of diaphragm fatigue is present could help us understand the patient's readiness to be extubated.\n\nDespite the frequent use of mechanical ventilation, determining when to appropriately discontinue mechanical ventilation and extubate a patient remains a challenge. Many weaning protocols exist but are typically extrapolated from adult studies. These protocols can consist of but are not limited to use sprint weaning utilizing a T-piece (no support, just oxygen), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or pressure support (PSV) trail. Usually, data is gathered through spirometry with a ventilator (shallow breathing index, tidal volumes, etc.) and vital signs are recorded [7, 8]. Despite the use of protocols extubation failure range from 15-24% (Randolph) in the pediatric population.\n\nInvestigators have explored physiological evidence of improving lung function to help determine the appropriate time to discontinue mechanical ventilation. One notable effort by Hubble et al was to obtain dead space to tidal volume ratio (Vd/Vt) to determine extubation success after a 30 minute PSV trail prior to extubation[9]. They concluded that a Vd/Vt ratio of less than or equal to 0.5 reliably predicted successful extubation (96%). However, this only provides one part of the equation - lung function- but not necessarily the central nervous system interaction or the work of breathing associated.\n\nCurrently, the MSICU uses an extubation readiness test (ERT). This test determines if patients are eligible for discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. This test consist of a daily screen of changing the FIO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) to 50% (left at current setting if lower than 50%) and decrease the PEEP to 5 cmH2O. Patients unable to maintain saturation (SpO2) of 95%, or become tachypneic, or appear uncomfortable failed the test; those who maintained SpO2 of 95% or higher have their mode of ventilation changed to minimal pressure support (PSV). Minimal PSV was determined by the endotracheal tube (ETT) size. Patients were classified as failing the test if at any time in the two hour period their SpO2 was less than 95%, their exhaled tidal volume was less than 5 mL/kg ideal body weight, or their respiratory rate was outside of the acceptable range for age. If the patient fails an ERT they are returned to their previous ventilator setting and evaluated for extubation readiness in 24 hours. It is understood that sedation is one of the primary caused of extubation failure, however there is additional concern regarding the diaphragmatic function. When the mechanical load of the respiratory system is too large or continues for a long period of time, the diaphragm can develop contractile fatigue[4]. This fatigue can be short or long term. Short term is also known as high-frequency fatigue that results from the accumulation of inorganic phosphate[5], failure of the membrane electrical potential[6], and to a lesser extent intramuscular acidosis[7], but recover quickly. On the other hand long term fatigue, otherwise known as low-frequency fatigue is consistent with muscle injury [8, 9] and can persist for days. Being able to identify what type of diaphragm fatigue could lead us to hold on extubation readiness testing as to not re-injury.\n\nWhen patients are extubated too early, respiratory failure can occur [10, 11]. When extubation is delayed, lengths of time on mechanical ventilation and in the ICU stay both increases. This leads to additional respiratory complications such as ventilator associated pneumonia and overall lung damage[12]. Thus, the decision to extubate should be made on the basis of accurate, objective and reproducible criteria. The diaphragmatic activity is likely one of those criteria that are not yet measured. We aim to add some additional information to this body of knowledge that may link the respiratory pump (diaphragm) to lung function, muscle fatigue, and/or central nervous system depression.\n\nPreliminary Studies/Progress Report To our knowledge there is not previous data determining if Edi can predict extubation success. However, there are a few limited studies on low and high-frequency diaphragm fatigue in adults and animals. Dr. Laghi and colleagues carefully examined 11 who failed extubation and eight adults whom successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation. They concluded that weaning itself did not cause low-frequency fatigue [13]. While Edi was examined in six health adults at high frequency fatigue levels. Edi was found to successfully assess neural drive and that diaphragm fatigue did not affect respiratory drive.\n\nLimits to the studies mentioned above that we plan to address are: none were done in children with highly resistive endotracheal tubes, length of mechanical ventilation was not examined (low vs. high frequency diaphragm fatigue risk), there was no formal ERT, and examination of low and high frequency diaphragm fatigue in the same patient population was not done.\n\nDesign and Methods a. Study Design In a prospective, blinded (Edi information blinded to the team) clinical trail we will study the diaphragmatic activity that occur prior and following our standard extubation readiness test (minimum pressure support trial). We will examine that diaphragmatic activity by examining the Edi prior to, during, and post the trial on every patient who qualifies. Furthermore, patients who fail ERT will be ventilated with the NAVA mode of ventilation. The entire protocol will be conducted on the Maquet Servo I ventilator"

          "Non-invasive assessment of blood flow to organs has long challenged clinicians. Recently, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been recognized as a methodology that may achieve this goal. A commercially available NIRS monitor, marketed by Somanetics, Inc., is now in widespread use in the clinical care of pediatric cardiac patients in the operating room and in the intensive care unit post-operatively. When a patch/probe from the monitor is placed on the forehead or lower back, blood oxygen concentration data is obtained which has been found to correlate with actual blood samples taken by IV. The presence of this NIRS data would give the surgeon important feedback about blood flow to important areas like the brain and kidneys during heart surgeries on children and after the operation is completed in the intensive care unit.\n\nThe investigator wishes to perform a prospective study of the NIRS monitor use with children that need heart surgeries that require heart-lung bypass and sometimes require monitoring in the ICU, post-operatively."

Patients that receive operations that require circulatory arrest and/or selective cerebral perfusion will be followed in the ICU for 5 days. Data from the bypass machine along, data collected from the NIRS and oximetric probe monitor, and serum data will be interfaced into a data collection system.\n\nData to be collected: Minimum patient demographic data (age, sex, ethnic origin), NIRS data, serum blood gas data, serum lactate levels, hemoglobin levels, vital signs, doppler blood flow data, LFT analysis, clinical course events/data (i.e. need for dialysis, length of stay, surgical time points, etc), diagnostic test results (EKGs, ECHOs, etc), significant medical history data, and standard of care laboratory results.\n\nThe investigator wishes to evaluate the relationship of this data with the patient's diagnosis, operation performed, post-operative course, and outcome.

Of the anti-cancer agents used frequently in infants and young children, the drug with the least amount of knowledge is actinomycin-D. Actinomycin-D, has been used for the treatment of several childhood cancers since the 1960s. Despite its longstanding and widespread use in pediatric oncology, there is virtually no pharmacokinetic information from which safe and appropriate age-based pediatric dosing can be derived. Actinomycin-D is an integral component of rhabdomyosarcoma and Wilms tumor therapy, and pediatric oncologists will continue to administer the durg despite the gap in knowledge."

Various treatment options are available to treat atopic dermatitis to include topical emollients, topical steroids, and topical calcineurin inhibitors. Each treatment option has benefits and potential risks. This study was done to determine if topical B12 could be a tolerable and efficacious alternative treatment option in this population.\n\nMETHODS: The study was conducted as a placebo-controlled, double-blind, prospective, randomized clinical trial with intraindividual left ⁄ right comparison. Parents were given 2 containers of creams and instructed to apply the Vitamin B12 cream to one side of the body and the placebo cream to the contralateral side according to the randomization scheme."

          "Diabetic nephropathy is a known cause of significant morbidity and mortality in adult patients with diabetes. Microalbuminuria (MA) is predictive of future diabetic nephropathy (DN) in adult patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). This link between MA levels and DN allows patients to receive timely interventions. The predictive value of MA for DN in children with DM, however, is not well established. Most studies looking at this association in children have only been forced to use adult MA values. Children, particularly adolescents, are known to have different normal values for 24-hour total protein excretion compared to adults and it may be that they also have different normal levels of MA. Little literature exists on normal levels of 24 hr MA in healthy children and in children with diabetes.\n\nIn this study, we seek to define the range of MA levels that falls between the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles for children with and without DM. Once these values are established, we will have a foundation for further studies to define which, if any, MA values are predictive of DN in children. If we can establish a MA level which is predictive of DN in children, it will allow physicians to direct medical intervention at those most likely to benefit while protecting others from unnecessary medications, procedures, and risks."

          "Adolescents are increasingly abusing and becoming dependent on heroin and other opioids. The number of emergency room visits related to heroin among 12-17 year olds rose almost 600%, and the self-reported prevalence of heroin use among this group more than doubled in the last decade. As a result of the increased availability of high-potency, low-cost heroin, many adolescents initiate heroin use by snorting it; however, many often then progress to injection of heroin. Despite the critical need to identify efficacious treatments for this population, virtually no research has been conducted to systematically characterize or evaluate treatment interventions for adolescent heroin and opioid abusers. We recently conducted the first controlled study funded by NIDA to systematically evaluate the efficacy of several pharmacotherapies as detoxification agents along with intensive behavioral interventions in the treatment of this population. The purpose of this study is to evaluate ways to further improve on the promising outcomes from our initial study via combined behavioral-buprenorphine treatment for opioid-dependent youth. The primary aim is to examine if improved treatment outcomes can be achieved if the duration of buprenorphine detoxification is lengthened (when the rate of decrease in buprenorphine dose is slower, withdrawal symptoms may be of reduced intensity and youth are provided with a greater opportunity to learn new skills and behaviors addressing how they might best discontinue their opiate use, prevent relapse, and meet treatment goals). A secondary aim is to examine if the provision of monetary voucher-based incentives contingent on consumption of the opioid antagonist, naltrexone, reduces rates of relapse to opiate use in adolescents post-detoxification compared to when no such incentives are provided. This analysis may provide critical empirical information regarding how to best prevent relapse to opioid use among opioid-dependent youth. Another secondary aim is to identify significant predictors of treatment outcome. We will thus conduct an exploratory evaluation of demographic, baseline drug use, psychological and other history variables that may predict successful treatment outcomes. This work may help inform the refinement of treatment interventions for various sub-populations of opioid-dependent youth. Outcome measures will include opiate and other drug abstinence, retention, opiate withdrawal symptoms, HIV risk behavior, family relationships, as well as a variety of other secondary outcome measures. We plan to collect these measures at intake, during treatment and at several post-treatment follow-up timepoints. Overall, this research will contribute new empirical information that will inform the development of effective treatment interventions for the largely unstudied and rapidly expanding population of opioid-dependent youth."

          "In other studies, TNFR:Fc significantly reduced joint pain and swelling in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and the Food and Drug Administration has approved the drug for that use. Because medicines for arthritis often help patients with eye inflammation, this study will examine whether TNFR:Fc can help patients with uveitis.\n\nPatients with uveitis who are not responding well to standard treatment, such as steroids, and patients who have side effects from other medicines used to treat their uveitis or have refused treatment because of possible side effects may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and eye examination. The eye exam includes a check of vision and eye pressure, examination of the back of the eye (retina), and front of the eye, including measurements of protein and inflammation. Candidates will also undergo fluorescein angiography-a procedure in which photographs are taken of the retina to see if there is any leakage in the eye's blood vessels. A blood test and joint evaluation will also be done.\n\nStudy participants will be given an injection of TNFR:Fc twice a week for up to 12 months and may continue other medicines they may be taking, such as prednisone or methotrexate. They will have follow-up examinations at week two and months one, two, three and four. Those who wish to continue treatment after the fourth month can receive the drug for another eight months and will have follow-up exams at months six, nine and 12, and one month after treatment ends. Each follow-up visit will include a repeat of the screening exams and an evaluation of side effects or discomfort from the medicine."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder of the hemoglobin in which the course of acute pain from vaso-occlusion and its sequelae vary widely across genotypes and individual patients. SCD pain often begins during childhood and can progress to chronic pain for approximately 23% of children and adolescents. Youth with chronic SCD pain, that is pain that is present on most days per month and persists for at least 6 months, report high levels of functional disability, elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, and reduced quality of life relative to youth with SCD without chronic pain. The complex, multifactorial nature of chronic SCD pain can also contribute to increased healthcare utilization for pain. The most effective management and treatment of chronic SCD pain likely requires individualized, multimodal, multidisciplinary treatments that go beyond pharmacological management alone. A range of evidence-based non-pharmacological treatments, such as behavioral health, complementary, and integrative health approaches, are recommended for chronic pain management and are gaining greater awareness and integration into comprehensive chronic pain care.\n\nBehavioral health treatment, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain, focuses on improved daily functioning and coping through several core treatment components such as psychoeducation about how the body processes pain, relaxation skills training, and cognitive strategies. Youth with chronic SCD pain need an evidence-based, culturally informed, adaptive treatment. Behavioral treatments that are tailored to patient and family needs are beneficial when patients may require different levels of care. Adaptive designs are more effective in improving health outcomes, satisfaction with treatment, and reducing healthcare use than standard protocols where patients receive a fixed \"one size fits all\" treatment that is not personalized to their needs; adaptive designs are also recommended for tailoring evidence-based interventions with culturally diverse populations. Adaptive treatments can integrate evidence-based strategies to address common co-morbid problems associated with chronic pain, such as elevated anxiety or depressive symptoms or sleep disturbance. Teaching parents problem-solving skills can reduce caregiver stress among families managing chronic pain and illness.\n\nThis study will utilize an adaptive behavioral treatment to target psychosocial risk factors for youth with chronic SCD pain as a first step towards developing a stepped care model for SCD pain."

          "Acute pancreatitis is increasingly common diagnosis in children. Most of the guidelines related to the details of management of acute pancreatitis are extrapolated from the adult literature. There is only limited data regarding management of acute pancreatitis in children. The mainstay of management is bowel and pancreatic rest with significant fluid support to minimize the effect of the cytokines on the pancreas and other organs. The standard fluid choices are Lactated Ringer's solution (LR) and normal saline (NS). Currently, both LR and NS are used at the discretion of the treating physician as the standard of care for acute pancreatitis. The investigators hope to examine the question of ideal fluid choice for fluid resuscitation in children with acute pancreatitis by assessing recovery time in the context of measured inflammatory markers and SIRS status at 24 and 48 hours after admission. The ideal fluid choice in the initial resuscitation of acute pancreatitis has not been effectively evaluated before in the pediatric population. Even if there is no statistically significant difference between the two fluid options, this trial will still provide clinically significant information."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Acute pancreatitis represents inflammation of the pancreas that has been well identified in the literature for several centuries. However, the phenomenon has only relatively recently gained prominence in the pediatric literature. The incidence can be as high as 13 per 100,000 per year, a level which approaches that seen in adults, and the diagnosis has been increasingly common over the last two decades. It affects all ages of children (including infants) evidenced by well-established age appropriate diagnostic criteria. The precise pathophysiological basis of the inflammation is not always as clear. Currently, the prevailing theory is that there is an insult to the acinar cells of the pancreas likely via an atypical calcium signal that releases a cascade of cellular activity and that ultimately results in a disseminated cytokine storm. While there is certainly debate as to the inciting event to this cascade, one thing that is clear is that extensive end-organ damage can occur if this cytokine storm reaches systemic circulation. Therefore, the mainstay of management is bowel (and specifically pancreatic) rest with significant fluid support to minimize or mitigate the effect of the cytokines on the pancreas and other systemic organs such as the lungs, heart, and kidneys. The remainder of therapy consists of appropriate analgesia and antiemetics.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the guidelines related to the details of management of acute pancreatitis are extrapolated from the adult literature. There is only limited data regarding management of acute pancreatitis in children. Recently, Wu et al. have shown compelling data that suggest the choice of fluid for management of acute pancreatitis in adults should be Lactated Ringers (LR). Their group demonstrated in a small randomized controlled trial involving 40 adult patients with acute pancreatitis, that the patients randomized to the LR arm of the study had significantly lower levels of C-reactive protein and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) markers compared with controls in the normal saline (NS) group. They proposed that the mechanism for this difference may be related to the more balanced pH of LR which might prevent, or at least further buffer, the systemic inflammation that is triggered by the release of the offending cytokines from the pancreas. Currently, both LR and NS are used at both Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters (CHKD) and Children's National Health System (CNHS) at the discretion of the attending physician as the standard of care for acute pancreatitis. The investigators hope to examine the question of ideal fluid choice for fluid resuscitation in children with acute pancreatitis by assessing recovery time in the context of measured inflammatory markers and SIRS status at 24 and 48 hours after admission.\n\nThis is a prospective randomized trial of pediatric patients in the emergency department (ED) or inpatient ward diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Patients meeting the study inclusion criteria will be identified by an ED or inpatient physician. The ED or inpatient physician will ask the eligible patient/parent if they are interested in hearing about the study. If the eligible patient/parent is interested in hearing information about the study, the ED or inpatient ward will notify the PI via telephone or page. The PI will come to the eligible patient's room to explain the study and answer any questions, or the PI will page a research team member to do so. If the patient/parent agrees to participate in the study, the research team member will consent the parents of the patients aged 0-17 years or consent patients aged 18 years. Assent will be obtained from patients aged 8-17 years. Non-English speaking patients/parents will be consented using an in-person translator or the blue phone translating service. These consent and assent forms will be signed by a witness. At the time of enrollment, the subject identification (ID) number and medical record number will be entered into the electronic Subject ID Key. Once the patient is enrolled in the study, their treatment will be randomized to either the LR or the NS group. Both treatments are current standard of care for acute pancreatitis. Patients who choose not to participate in the study will receive the standard of care treatment at the discretion of the attending physician, which may involve either fluid, and will likely include most (if not all) of the lab studies as outlined in this protocol.\n\nThe goal is to screen and enroll the subjects in either the ED or inpatient ward within 6 hours of diagnosis, as this is within the theoretical window prior to the development of systemic inflammation. At the discretion of the attending physician, however, treatment can begin in the ED or inpatient ward before enrollment in the study; patients will not have to wait for necessary treatments. Patients will still be eligible to participate in the study if treatment was begun in the ED or inpatient ward. The randomized treatment may end up being the same or different than what was originally ordered by the attending physician. If any such changes in treatment plan are noted, this will be considered for the data analysis.\n\nThe randomization plan will include constrained randomization using the permuted blocks method. The research team member will open the envelope that contains the randomized treatment and the Admission Order Sheet that details the orders that need to be placed on admission. The research team member will communicate this information to the ED or inpatient attending physician or staff member overseeing the patient's care at the time of enrollment. All clinical treatments described in this protocol, including labs orders, are the current standard of care for acute pancreatitis diagnosis. The purpose of the Admission Order Sheet is to standardize the timeline of the lab work at admission, at 24 hours and 48 hours after admission, not to request any additional lab work for the purposes of the study.\n\nThe subject will be placed on 1.5x maintenance IVF with the fluids to which they are randomized. The patient will remain nil per os (NPO) for at least the first 24 hours, and the time of initiating feeds after 24 hours will be at the discretion of the admitting team. As the standard of care, the following studies will be obtained at the time of admission if not previously obtained in the ED: Complete Metabolic Panel (CMP), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), Amylase, Lipase, Triglycerides, Complete Blood Count (CBC), and CRP, along with an abdominal ultrasound. CBC, CRP, amylase and lipase levels will be obtained at 24 and 48 hours (+/- 2 hours) as listed in the Admission Order Sheet. Similarly, a Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) will be collected at 24 and 48 hours (+/- 2 hours), with the addition of liver function tests if liver enzyme levels are elevated at admission (as defined by transaminases greater than 2 times the age appropriate upper limit of normal). SIRS status will be evaluated with vital sign checks every 4 hours and the leukocyte counts every 24 hours.\n\nThe patients will be observed for additional known signs and complications of acute pancreatitis such as persistent inflammation, shock, sepsis, electrolyte abnormalities, renal failure or other end organ damage. Any adverse reactions during the trial will be treated independent of the trial, and the attending physician will continue to manage the care of the patient at their discretion. Any serious adverse reactions will be documented clinically and reported to the CHKD or CNHS incident reporter systems, Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS) Institutional Review Board (IRB), CNHS IRB and CHKD Human Research Coordination (HRC) Committee .\n\nThe de-identified information will be collected from the patient's electronic medical record by a research team member and entered directly into an Excel database. Patients transferred from an outside ED should already have charts scanned into the Electronic Health Record (EHR) as standard of care. If only a paper chart is available for any transferred patient, a research team member will enter information directly from the paper chart into the Excel database."

          "This trial will examine the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a web-based HIV, hepatitis and STI prevention intervention when offered to youth in outpatient, community-based substance abuse treatment as directly compared to a traditional HIV (and infectious disease) prevention intervention. We will assess the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these interventions by primarily examining changes from pre- to post-intervention in accurate HIV/disease prevention knowledge, intentions to engage in safer sex and HIV risk behavior. Additionally, we will examine the extent to which the interventions impact relevant skills acquisition (e.g., communication skills, negotiation skills and condom use skills), attitudes toward safer sex and self-reported substance use, as well as the acceptability of each intervention. We also plan to evaluate youth at both 1 and 3 month post-intervention to examine the durability of effects (including any differential durability of effects across intervention conditions). The web-delivered prevention intervention to be evaluated in this study has the potential to allow for a complex intervention to be delivered at a low cost, without increasing demands on staff time or training needs, and may thereby expand the reach of evidence-based prevention for youth in substance-abuse treatment.\n\nThis study will be conducted at three collaborating, community-based adolescent substance abuse treatment programs all of which are housed within the Daytop Village network of services and are located in New York City: (1) Daytop Village's Brooklyn Outreach Center; (2) Daytop Village's Bronx Outreach Center; and (3) Daytop Village's Queens Outreach Center. We expect to recruit approximately one third of the total number of participants from each site.\n\nA total of up to 160 (no fewer than 120) adolescent participants will be enrolled in this study. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two study conditions in an intent-to-treat design (n=60-80 per group): (1) computer-delivered intervention or (2) traditional (person-delivered intervention). Participants in the traditional prevention intervention condition will complete two sessions (of approx. one hour in duration) across the course of a week, conducted by a trained HIV (and infectious disease) prevention educator; these sessions will typically be conducted in small groups of 2-4 participants but may be offered individually. Participants in the computer-delivered intervention condition will complete an interactive, web-based HIV, hepatitis and STI prevention program instead of the traditional, person-delivered prevention intervention. Youth will be asked to complete a customized plan of approximately 2-4 hours in length using the web-based tool; participants will complete two 60-minute sessions per week until they complete their customized plan. Participants will access this intervention using dedicated computer stations set up at their substance abuse treatment program."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the esophagus. Primary symptoms manifest while eating and include dysphagia, chest pain, and food impaction. EoE was first described in the 1990s, but is increasingly recognized worldwide. It affects both adults and children.\n\nGiven that EoE is thought to be an allergen driven disease, elimination diets are considered logical and safe first-line treatment options. Elimination diets focus on the removal of the food groups most likely to evoke the inflammatory response (e.g. dairy, wheat, soy, egg, etc.). This is the first study to examine the effects of an additive free diet on eosinophilic esophagitis.\n\nPrimary Objective: To compare histologic outcomes (eosinophils per high power field: eos/hpf) of DED and FREE in children with eosinophilic esophagitis.\n\nSecondary Objective: To compare endoscopic outcomes (Eosinophilic Esophagitis Endoscopic Reference scores: EREFs) of DED and FREE in children with eosinophilic esophagitis\n\nTertiary Objectives: To compare symptomatic (Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis Symptom Severity Module v2.0: PEESS) and quality of life (Peds-QL EoE Module 1) outcomes of DED and FREE in children with eosinophilic esophagitis\n\nThe investigators plan to enroll 72 patients over 4 sites each enrolling 18 patients per site in a 16-month period (approximately 1 patient per month per site) having 9 patients per site in each group (DED and FREE).\n\nThe investigators will enroll patients > 5- <17 years of age with isolated esophageal eosinophilia (>15 eos/hpf). Patients with food impaction, peripheral eosinophilia > 1,500 µL , concomitant GI inflammatory conditions, history of upper GI tract surgery (e.g. fundoplication), acid reflux by pH probe, anaphylactic food allergies, severe developmental delay, taking recently prescribed inhaled corticosteroids or oral corticosteroids, have other medical conditions likely interfere with the study, has a significant psychiatric condition, has taken a PPI in the last 4 weeks, has taken swallowed steroids in the last 12 weeks, or are not fluent in spoken and written English will be excluded.\n\nParticipants will be enrolled at: Nemours Children's Hospital, Orlando, FL; Alfred I Dupont Hospital, Wilmington, DE; Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA\n\nOnce eligibility criteria are met, participants will be randomized to DED or FREE study groups. Participants will receive dietary education. Lead dietitians from each site will be identified and the approaches to dietary education will be standardized. Dietary education will be completed at the baseline visit and during follow up phone calls throughout the study.Each participant will complete all study visits in 12 weeks."

          "This is a randomized clinical trial of epiphysiodesis techniques: percutaneous transphyseal screw epiphysiodesis versus percutaneous drill epiphysiodesis for the correction of leg length discrepancy. Failed epiphysiodesis was selected as the primary outcome. Failed epiphysiodesis was defined as one or more of the following: development of angular deformity > 5°, revision epiphysiodesis, or growth inhibition < 70% of expected. EOS, low dose biplanar X-Ray, will be used to make all length measurements. Secondary outcomes assess mean growth at the physis following epiphysiodesis, in the subset of patients with bead implantation, fluoroscopy and operative times, length of stay, return to full weight bearing, as well as functional and quality of life outcomes. The following outcome scales will be used to measure pain (VAS), quality of life (PROMIS Pediatric Pain Interference Scale), and function (PROMIS Pediatric Mobility Scale, Pedi-FABS, and UCLA Activity Score). Each of these scales has been validated for use in children (Beyer, Denyes, & Villarruel, 1992; DeWitt et al., 2011; Fabricant et al., 2013; Novais et al., 2014; Varni et al., 2010a). We will also determine the cost associated with each technique and perform a cost-effectiveness analysis to establish which technique is preferred from a societal perspective."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Drill and screw epiphysiodesis are the two most common techniques for surgical correction of predicted limb length discrepancies 2-5cm. Both procedures require minimal incisions, less than 1cm, (Canale & Christian, 1990; Metaizeau et al., 1998). Previous studies have demonstrated that both drill and screw epiphysiodesis result in improved outcomes compared to open techniques (Alzahrani, Behairy, Alhossan, Arab, & Alammari, 2003; Canale & Christian, 1990). Moreover, alternative approaches such as medial and lateral 8 plates may not sufficiently tether growth, or cause peripheral but not central growth arrest (Stewart et al., 2013). We selected drill vs. screw epiphysiodesis as the two treatment groups as they are both minimally invasive, relatively effective, in common usage, and are thought to differ in costs and other characteristics.\n\nAlthough outcomes of drill and screw epiphysiodesis exist{{10 Campens,C. 2010; 11 Ghanem,I. 2011}} , the assessments are retrospective non-randomized series, which may be at risk for selection bias, and may not adequately capture all of the outcomes of interest, depending on what data is routinely collected and documented in the medical chart. To our knowledge, no prospective randomized comparison of epiphysiodesis techniques and clinical outcomes has been published accurately assessing how effective each technique is in disabling growth at the physis, or taking into account patient-centered outcomes or cost. Operative measures such as the surgical time and radiation exposure from intra-operative fluoroscopy have not previously been compared. Patient-centered outcomes such as level of pain, activity, and function by measures such PROMIS and Ped-FABS, have not been previously assessed in this population. The proposed research study aims to fill this gap.\n\nThis study was designed as a multicenter randomized trial to answer an important clinical question and to do so with a clearly defined objective and validated outcomes. This trial can be executed on a relatively small budget with simple outcome measures, and recruitment of a moderate number of patients at each of a few centers well equipped for research. By involving multiple surgeons and patients from various geographies, we improve the generalizability of this study. Our institution and collaborating institutions have been successful in completing randomized clinical trials in the past. This study will answer a clinical question that is important and current, providing orthopedic surgeons with an evidence-based identification of the ideal technique for treating predicted limb length discrepancies 2-7cm.\n\nThis study will also be the first to accurately measure mean growth following both epiphysiodesis techniques, through implantation of tantalum beads in consenting participants. These beads will provide stationary landmarks by which growth can be measured directly, and not inferred. Previous methods of judging epiphysiodesis success have primarily relied on assessing efficacy by estimating growth inhibition through calculation. Tantalum beads have been successfully used in adults and children (Lauge-Pedersen,H. 2006), and although it requires implantation of small radio-opaque beads, it is considered the gold standard when making detailed radiographic measures, and the optimal technique for physeal growth measurements.(Lauge-Pedersen,H. 2006)(Haugan,K. 2012). Over 300 000 beads have been inserted in vivo without significant complications."

        "BriefSummary": [
          "Traumatic, debilitating anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries occur at a 2 to 10-fold greater rate in female than male athletes. Consequently, there is a larger population of females that endure significant pain, functional limitations, and radiographic signs of knee osteoarthritis (OA) within 12 to 20 years following injury. To reduce the burden of OA, The National Public Health Agenda for Osteoarthritis recommends expanding and refining evidence-based prevention of ACL injury. Specialized training that targets modifiable risk factors shows statistical efficacy in high-risk athletes; however, clinically meaningful reduction of risk has not been achieved. A critical barrier that limits successful training outcomes is the requirement of qualified instructors to deliver personalized, intuitive, and accessible feedback to young athletes. Thus, a key gap in knowledge is how to efficiently deliver objective, effective feedback during training for injury prevention. The investigators long-term goal is to reduce ACL injuries and the subsequent sequela in young female athletes. The overall objective of this proposal is to implement and test innovative augmented neuromuscular training (aNMT) techniques to enhance sensorimotor learning and reduce biomechanical risk factors for ACL injury. The rationale that underlies this proposal is that, after completion, the investigators will be equipped to more effectively deliver biofeedback and decelerate the trend of increasing ACL injury rates in female athletes. This contribution will be significant for the reduction of the long-term sequel following ACL injury in young females."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Augmented neuromuscular training (aNMT) integrates biomechanical screening with state-of-the-art augmented reality headsets to display real-time feedback that maps complex biomechanical variables onto simple visual feedback stimuli that athletes \"control\" via their own movements. The central hypothesis is that aNMT biofeedback will improve joint mechanics in evidence-based measures collected in realistic, sport-specific virtual reality scenarios. Specifically, the purpose of this investigation is to determine the efficacy of aNMT biofeedback to improve high-risk landing mechanics both in a laboratory task and during sport-specific scenarios. Based on the investigator's preliminary data, the investigators hypothesize that aNMT biofeedback will produce greater improvements in localized joint mechanics compared to neuromuscular training that incorporates sham feedback during the drop vertical jump (DVJ) task. In the secondary Aim, the investigators hypothesize aNMT will produce improved localized joint mechanics and global injury risk techniques during sport-specific maneuvers assessed in immersive virtual environments compared to the sham feedback. The expected outcomes will support increased efficiency and enhanced efficacy of feedback for personalized and targeted injury prevention training. The positive impact will be the improvement of injury risk mechanics and the potential to reduce injury on the field of play. A randomized, repeated-measures design will be used to test the two hypotheses for Aim 1: First, that aNMT will produce greater improvements in localized joint mechanics compared to the sham feedback group during the DVJ task; second, based on the preliminary data the investigators expect that innovative aNMT will lead to graduated joint improvements and reduced global injury risk mechanics that will exceed the overall task transferred reductions in high risk biomechanics following 12 real-time biofeedback training sessions. Previously described techniques will be used to measure biomechanical risk factors during a DVJ task performed at the beginning and end of the 6-week pre-competition training period. Athletes will be randomized into one of two groups: 1) aNMT biofeedback or (2) sham (augmented reality glasses with a stimulus that will provide exercise repetition count). Each athlete, as well as the statisticians, will be blinded to the intervention. All athletes will receive 12 training sessions over a 6-week period during their pre-competition season and each of the groups will have longitudinal assessment of biomechanical outcome measures captured at each biofeedback session. All participants will complete pre-training testing, 6 weeks of intervention, post-training testing, and post-season testing."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is changing the paradigm of clinical genetic testing. Unlike highly focused single-gene tests, NGS allows one to examine gene panels, the exome, and the whole genome. With the broad array of molecular tests now available, ordering physicians face the conundrum of selecting the best diagnostic tool for patients with suspected genetic conditions. Single-gene testing is often most appropriate for conditions with distinctive clinical features and minimal locus heterogeneity. NGS-based gene panel testing, which can be complemented with chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and other ancillary methods, provides a comprehensive and feasible approach for well documented but genetically heterogeneous disorders. Whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) have the advantage of enabling parallel interrogation of most of the genes in the human genome. To some, WES is preferable to previously used methods due to higher diagnostic yield, shorter time to diagnosis, and improved cost-efficiency.\n\nThe ability to survey the exome opens up both new opportunities and new challenges. For example, all coding regions of known genes must be analyzed when applying WES to undiagnosed cases with unclear inheritance patterns. Current limitations on variant interpretation capabilities and clinical validity raise questions about the clinical utility of WES as either a stand-alone or a first-choice diagnostic test. Additional challenges include pre- and post-test counseling with appropriate and robust informed consent, bioinformatics analysis setup and validation, variant interpretation and classification, the need for policies and protocols concerning the discovery and reporting of secondary findings unrelated to the presenting indication, a requirement for validation of WES results, assurance of conformation to quality control standards, data storage and accessibility, and reimbursement issues.\n\nIntroducing WES into pediatric clinical care of underrepresented populations raises additional issues and considerations of payment coverage, access, and standards of care. Beyond the sheer complexity of the test and its results, clinicians and health systems must address numerous considerations, including: private and public insurance coverage; language and culture differences and their implications for genetic counseling and clinician-patient relationships; ability to access follow-up testing and clinical care; and ability to access appropriate treatment and services. These issues and others will affect not only patients' decision-making regarding WES, but also their post-test needs for patient follow up. The importance of systematically assessing the clinical utility of NGS is critical for determining in which clinical and health care contexts WES will be useful and for commencing research on these considerations."

        "BriefSummary": [
          "Pain management in pediatric patients presents a difficult challenge. Unlike adults, pediatric patients often cannot communicate their pain management needs clearly. Adequate pain control after surgery is pivotal for these patients in order to prevent negative physiologic and psychologic complications and to improve surgical outcomes. There is an ongoing shift away from the use of opioids in the post-operative setting due to both their negative side effects and their high potential for dependence and abuse.\n\nA variety of new techniques of multimodal pain management have been developed and utilized in elective orthopaedic procedures. Injection of local anesthetics is becoming a widely popular technique utilized in adult arthroplasty. This technique blocks pain directly at the site of injection, and therefore can improve post-operative pain while minimizing side effects. Evidence has demonstrated this technique to be both safe and effective, resulting in reduced opioid consumption post-operatively. However, this technique has not been studied for use in pediatric patients, a population in which reduced narcotic use is equally, if not more important than in adult patients.\n\nThis study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial with 2 parallel arms. The goal of this study is to assess the efficacy of a surgical-site pain injection administered in pediatric patients with cerebral palsy undergoing major hip surgery. Patients who are scheduled to undergo surgery will be randomized to either intervention (injection of a pain cocktail) or placebo (injection of normal saline). The pain cocktail includes three medications: ropivacaine (a local anesthetic), ketorolac (an anti-inflammatory medication), and epinephrine (a medication to constrict blood vessels and increase the duration of action of any co-administered medications). A surgeon who is blinded to treatment group will administer the injection at the end of the procedure, prior to the patient waking from anesthesia. The injection is in addition to our typical multi-modal pain control protocol, which includes epidural anesthesia, acetaminophen, anti-inflammatories, oral narcotics and anti-spasmodic agents. Patients will then be monitored post-operatively and pain medication consumption (both while in the hospital post-operatively and for the first two weeks following discharge), patient-reported and/or nurse-recorded pain scores, length of hospital stay, and adverse effects will be recorded. At the first post-operative visit, patients' parents will be asked to complete a survey designed to assess parent satisfaction with their child's pain management after surgery. Patients, parents, and surgeons will be blinded to treatment group allocation. Data will be collected while the patient is in the hospital, after surgery (average duration 3-4 days), and at the first post-operative visit two to three weeks after surgery."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "With the ongoing opioid epidemic in the United States, there has been a shift toward the use of non-opioid alternatives for pain control in the post-operative period. The development of a multimodal approach to pain management has seen a rise in the use of local anesthesia, whether as a peripheral nerve block or as an peri/intra-articular injection. These techniques have shown to be very effective in the adult population for improving pain and reducing the need for opioid consumption post-operatively. However, these techniques have yet to be studied in the pediatric population. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a local anesthetic injection post-operatively in pediatric patients with cerebral palsy undergoing major surgery as part of a multi-modal pain control protocol. The investigators hypothesize that peri-articular injection of a pain cocktail containing a mix of local anesthetic, anti-inflammatory medication, and epinephrine at the end of surgery will result in decreased opioid use in the immediate peri-operative period in pediatric patients with cerebral palsy undergoing proximal femoral osteotomy when compared to an injection of normal saline. The investigators also hypothesize that the pain injection will result in decreased mean pain scores post-operatively, shorter hospital stays and improved parent satisfaction when compared to normal saline injection. With this study, the investigators hope to provide evidence to support the use of a minimally invasive, safe-to-use pain injection that will reduce the need for opioids in pediatric patients undergoing orthopaedic procedures.\n\nStudy Design:\n\nThis study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial with 2 parallel arms. Patients will be randomly assigned to the 2 treatment groups: surgical-site injection with ropivacaine, ketorolac, and epinephrine, or surgical-site injection with normal saline. Randomization will be performed via random number generator and will be carried out by a research associate who will not participate in study recruitment or outcomes assessment. Allocations will be concealed on a password-protected database accessible only to the research associate. Patients, surgeons, and nursing staff who perform post-operative assessments will be blinded to treatment allocation.\n\nSurgical Procedure:\n\nPatients undergoing unilateral or bilateral hip proximal femoral osteotomies will be included in the study. All patients will be treated with standard-of-care techniques chosen by the treating surgeon. The addition of pelvic osteotomies and/or soft tissue procedures will be at the discretion of the treating surgeon and will not exclude the patient from the study. Written consent will be obtained for all patients prior to the surgical procedure. Parental consent will be obtained, in addition to patient assent for all patients of appropriate age and intellectual capability. All patients will have a general anesthetic with a lumbar epidural. No preemptive scheduled analgesic regimen will be employed. All medications administered during induction and maintenance of anesthesia will be managed by the anesthesiologist and titrated at their discretion.\n\nThe local anesthetic group will be injected with a cocktail totaling 40 milliliters (mL) (20mL on each side) that will be composed of ropivicaine 2mg/mL (3mg/kg), epinephrine 1mg/mL (0.5mg), ketorolac 30mg/mL (0.5mg/kg). The control group will receive 40mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution. The injection will be performed while the patient is still under general anesthesia, following wound closure, and will be injected evenly between the deep and superficial tissues in an extra-articular pattern (no injection of the synovium or capsule). All injections will be performed using a 20-gauge needle. All medications will be obtained from the hospital pharmacy. All injections will be prepared by an operating room nurse under the supervision of a research assistant, and placed in an unlabeled syringe to allow for blinding of the surgeon administering the injection.\n\nPost-Operative Protocol:\n\nThe epidural anesthesia will be started at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist either before or on-arrival to the post-anesthesia care unit. Any additional medications administered during the immediate post-operative period in the post-anesthesia care unit will be prescribed by the attending anesthesiologist and will not be standardized. Beginning when the patient leaves the post-anesthesia care unit, all patients will be given the following pain regimen: acetaminophen (15mg/kg PO or per g-tube every 6 hours around the clock), ketorolac (0.5mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 3 doses) followed by ibuprofen (10mg/kg PO or per g-tube every 8 hours as needed for mild pain (pain score 1-3)), diazepam (0.1mg/kg PO or per g-tube every 6 hours around the clock for 36 hours followed by every 6 hours as needed for muscle spasms), and oxycodone (0.1mg/kg PO or per g-tube every 6 hours as needed for severe pain (pain score 7-10)). Nurses will be instructed to offer this as-needed medication to patients at standardized intervals every 4 hours when performing pain assessments. Additional medication for pain may be administered if the protocol does not result in adequate pain relief, at the discretion of the treating physician. The epidural will be titrated by the acute pain anesthesiology team for inadequate pain control, and all epidurals will be discontinued the morning of post-operative day two. All patients will be discharged on a standardized medication regimen as follows: diazepam (0.1mg/kg PO or per g-tube every 6 hours for 14 days), oxycodone (0.5mg/kg PO or per g-tube every 6 hours as needed for severe pain, 20 doses), acetaminophen (15mg/kg PO or per g-tube every 6 hours for 14 days), and ibuprofen (10mg/kg PO or per g-tube every 8 hours for 14 days). Inpatient and outpatient narcotic consumption will be recorded as morphine equivalents per kilogram, to allow adjustment for the weight-based dosing used in pediatric patients.\n\nAll other aspects of post-operative care, including (but not limited to) physical therapy, weight bearing status, mobilization, and bracing will be decided on a case-by-case basis by the treating surgeon.\n\nData Collection and Protection:\n\nData will be collected by approved research personnel via access to the medical record. Personal identifying information collected will include name, date of birth, medical record number, and telephone number. All data will be labeled with a code that can be linked to this personal identifying information. Data will be collected only from the hospitalization following the surgical procedure and from the first post-operative visit. This data will include: narcotic consumption, pain scores, complications or adverse events, and re-admission in the immediate post-operative period (first two weeks post-operatively). All data will be stored on a secure, encrypted data storage device or password protected and encrypted internet-based storage device."

However, most people with SCD do not receive CBT-based treatment due to barriers such as poor accessibility, limited availability of professionals, and high costs. First, the investigators plan to apply a user-centered design approach to develop and refine the iCanCope with SCD program. Second, program feasibility and initial program effectiveness will be determined through a pilot three-site randomized controlled trial. The investigators will determine study accrual and dropout rates as well as levels of patient acceptability and engagement. Preliminary effectiveness will be determined in youth receiving treatment compared to attention control on a range of physical, behavioral, and psychosocial outcomes assessed at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. Third, moderators and mediators of treatment effect will be tested by examining whether differences in self-efficacy and patient activation predict changes in pain and functioning. These results will enable a future full-scale randomized controlled trial."

          "The introduction of triple combination CFTR modulator therapy for patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) with at least one copy of the deltaF508 mutation is expected to provide major health benefits, but will also require novel outcome measures that can detect CF lung disease at an early stage, capture the efficacy of new therapies when disease manifestations are limited, as well as determine whether stopping existing chronic maintenance therapies does not have negative effects.\n\nIn the past decade, research has focused on the multiple breath washout (MBW) test, as a sensitive outcome measure, especially if highly-effective modulator therapies are initiated in early childhood. Even LCI, however, may not adequately capture early lung function changes, thus warranting investigation of even more sensitive outcome measures.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the advantage of being a radiation-free modality, making it more suitable for assessing response to therapy in a shorter time frame with repeated imaging. Inhalation of a hyperpolarized gas enables the visualization and quantification of regional ventilation in the lung and can be combined with structural MRI to assess both structure and function in parallel.\n\nThe main Investigator and others have recently formed an international consortium (the 129Xe MRI Clinical Trial Consortium), comprised of both imaging experts and pulmonary clinicians to standardize imaging procedures, thus facilitating multi-site implementations. Data from this proposed study (HyPOINT; Hyperpolarized Imaging for New Treatments) will inform the future utility of MRI for both longitudinal studies to track disease progression over time as well as for future interventional trials. Further, the current study could inform the design of future trials of interventions of patients for whom currently no effective CFTR modulator therapy is available and for patients with rare genotypes thus laying the groundwork for a more personalized medicine approach in the near-term future."

SickKids in Toronto, Canada, will submit their review through their institution's Research Ethics Board (REB).\n\nPhase 1 will include implementation of a centralized analysis program of repeated 129Xe MRI scanning in CF patients with mild lung disease to define the intra-subject variability of the primary outcome ventilation defect percentage (VDP). Patients will undergo baseline 129Xe MRI scanning and repeated measurements the same day, as well as at 28 days (± 7 days). Phase 1 will establish the intra-subject reproducibility to facilitate future use of 129Xe MRI in multi-site studies. Furthermore, the reproducibility limits defined will inform the overall design of future studies and will compare to established pulmonary function and multiple-breath washout testing (via measurement of the lung clearance index, LCI).\n\nSafety of 129Xe MRI will be assessed by recording adverse events during the study visit (see 8.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events), which will be followed until resolved. Vital signs (heart rate, SPO2) will be recorded before, immediately following inhalation, and 2 minutes after each 129Xe inhalation; O2 saturation will be monitored continuously throughout the 129Xe portion of the MRI, and the time and duration of nadir will be recorded.\n\nPhase 2 will be an observational study of patients assessed before and after the clinical initiation of triple-combination modulator therapy (after presumed FDA and Health Canada approval). The primary endpoint for Phase 2 is the change of VDP after 28 days of triple-combination modulator therapy. Within Phase 2, this study will also address how highly-effective modulator therapies affect lung function trajectories by measuring 129Xe MRI at 28 days (± 7 days), 6 months (± 28 days), and 12 months (± 28 days) after start of therapy (paralleling time points of the PROMISE study). Finally, to understand how 129Xe MRI can be used in combination with existing measures of lung function (e.g. spirometry, multiple breath washout), Investigators will directly compare the repeated data collected in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 to these established measures of lung function that are currently used in observational and interventional studies.\n\nThe overarching goal of this study is to define the role of structural and functional MRI imaging to facilitate future CF research studies."

        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Up to 5% of adolescents (~3.5 million in the US alone) suffer from high impact chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain, affecting all life domains and posing a significant economic burden. Current treatments for chronic MSK pain are suboptimal and have been tied to the opioid crisis. Only ~50% of adolescents with chronic MSK pain who present for multidisciplinary pain treatment recover, as measured by clinical endpoints of pain severity and functional disability. Discovery of robust markers of the recovery vs. persistence of pain and disability is essential to develop more resourceful and patient-specific treatment strategies and to conceive novel approaches that benefit patients who are refractory. Given that chronic pain is a biopsychosocial process, the discovery and validation of a prognostic and robust signature for pain recovery vs. persistence requires measurements across multiple dimensions in the same patient cohort in combination with a suitable 'big data' computational analysis pipeline for the extraction of reliable and cross-validated results from a multilayered and complex dataset. The research team is well positioned to execute the study aims with: (1) A highly skilled and experienced team of scientists and clinicians from Stanford University, University of Toronto/Hospital for Sick Children, and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; (2) A standardized specimen collection, processing, storage, and distribution system, leveraging Stanford Biobank's platform, BioCatalyst, to aggregate the sample inventory with clinical annotations for an accessible, virtual biobank, within the Signature of Pain Recovery IN Teens (SPRINT) Biobank and Analysis Core (SBAC); (3) Cutting-edge preliminary data implicating novel candidates for neuroimaging, immune, quantitative sensory, and psychological markers for discovery; and (4) Expertise in machine learning approaches to extract reliable and prognostic bio-signatures from a large and complex data set. The research team expects that the results from this project will facilitate risk stratification in patients with chronic MSK, a more resourceful selection of patients who are likely to respond for undergoing current multidisciplinary pain treatment approaches, and new insight into biological and behavioral processes that may be exploited to develop novel strategies profiting those who are refractory.\n\nFor the R61/Discovery Phase Aim individuals will be thoroughly characterized via biological (i.e. brain structure and function, immune, sensory profiles), psychological state, and clinical endpoint (i.e., pain intensity, disability) data. Unbiased machine learning algorithms will identify a multivariate model comprised of the most prognostic biological, psychological, and clinical endpoints. The model will classify adolescents with and without resolving chronic MSK pain after a state-of-the art multidisciplinary pain treatment intervention. R33/Validation Phase Aim will validate the biological signature derived in the R61 study. This signature will be useful for a range of adolescent-based clinical trials in which identification of the highest risk individuals is necessary, providing a clinically actionable intervention algorithm."

          "Neuroblastoma, the most common extra-cranial solid tumour in children, remains one of the major challenges in paediatric oncology. A promising way to further improve outcome in this disease appears to be the development of adjuvant therapeutic strategies. In this research the anti-GD2 antibody, which is a standard treatment, is to be combined with 131-l Metaiodobenzylguanidine (mlBG) and anti-Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (anti-PD1) antibody Nivolumab - the investigated drugs - with the aim of generating sustained anti-neuroblastoma immunity. In particular it will be determined the safety and tolerability of the novel combination as well as documented any evidence of efficacy in paediatric patients with relapsed and refractory high risk neuroblastoma.\n\nThis study is sponsored by the University Hospital Southampton and will take place in 4 hospitals in the United Kingdom, Germany and USA. The estimated duration of the study is 2 years, starting in December 2016.\n\nThis is an \"adaptive study\". Such design uses accumulating of data from the ongoing trial to modify aspects of the study (e.g. duration, number of treatments) without undermining its validity or integrity. There will be 3 cohorts of patients. As safety of Nivolumab is well established, Cohort 1 will assess its safety and tolerability in combination with 131-l mlBG. Cohort 2 will then add anti-GD2 to the drug combination, assessing safety and tolerability. Cohort 3 will escalate all 3 agents to the full 100% dose level to assure safety for expanded analyses of clinical and laboratory data at that dose level.\n\nPatients will initially be recruited into Cohort 1. Patients must have completed at least 12 weeks of trial treatment without reaching a Dose Limiting Toxicity before a patient can be recruited to the next cohort.\n\nA minimum of 3 evaluable patients will be treated in cohorts 1-3. Assuming the full dose combination therapy (cohort) is tolerable, 15 evaluable patients will be treated."

          "Robot assisted gait training is seen as a promising intervention for improving the walking abilities of children with cerebral palsy, but research to support its effectiveness compared to best practice physical therapy is lacking. This research consists of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and a qualitative descriptive study that is linked with the RCT. The goal of the RCT is to compare: 1) a walking training program with the Lokomat® robotic device (LOK), 2) a functional physical therapy program (fPT) that includes activities to enhance balance/co-ordination/endurance and advanced motor skills conducted over 'real ground', 3) a combined Lokomat® + functional physical therapy (LOK+fPT) program, and 4) a regular maintenance therapy condition (CONT) for ambulatory children and youth with CP (aged 5- 18 years). The three intervention programs will consist of sixteen 50-minute sessions given twice weekly over 8 to 10 weeks. The primary objective of the RCT is to compare the four groups with respect to walking-related motor skills as measured by the Gross Motor Function Measure. The secondary objectives are to compare each intervention's impact on walking abilities, individualized goals, fitness, balance, physical activity levels, child's belief in ability to do physical activity, participation and quality of life. The investigators will also evaluate the extent of carryover or progress 3 months after the intervention. The qualitative part of the study will consist of interviews of children and parents after they have finished the study intervention. The information from the interviews will assist us with interpretation of the outcome results (areas of impact and amount of change) from the RCT. In particular, the interviews will 1) provide insight into their experiences with the trial interventions, 2) identify the mobility-related outcomes that are important to families and the factors that influence their preferences, and 3) explain the family values, experiences and contextual factors that influenced participation in the study. This research will provide information needed to allow clinicians and families to make informed choices about Lokomat therapy and physical therapy options in relation to their child's functional goals and abilities."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of childhood physical disability, affecting 2.0-2.5 in 1000 children. CP represents a group of disorders of movement and posture with impairments (e.g., muscle weakness, decreased selective motor control, alterations in muscle tone, and impairment of postural control) that collectively affect functional mobility. About 65% of children/youth with CP use minimal or no assistive devices (leg braces, walkers, and/or wheelchairs) to walk (i.e., Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) Levels I and II) while children in GMFCS Levels III - V require varying degrees of bracing, walkers and other walking devices, wheelchairs, or assistance from others for mobility.\n\nRobotic Assisted Gait training devices are increasingly used with children with CP to improve their gait related motor skills. The Lokomat® (LOK) is a commercially available robot assisted gait training system that uses robotics to simulate walking. It facilitates inter-limb co-ordination and gait cycle timing and provides variable degrees of body weight support and guidance.\n\nThis study represents the first adequately powered RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of robot assisted gait training for children with CP. The qualitative aspect will give contextual information to assist with interpretation of the RCT and provide valuable information about families' experiences with the interventions.\n\nThe research questions for this study are:\n\ni) What is the comparative effectiveness of robot assisted gait training (LOK) and fPT program for improving gait related motor skills of ambulatory children and youth with CP? ii) Does combining LOK and fPT result in greater improvements in gait related motor skills of ambulatory children and youth with CP than robot assisted gait training or fPT alone? iii) What are families' experiences with trial participation and what implications do they have for interpretation of the quantitative results and the use of robot assisted gait training and fPT in clinical settings?\n\nMethods This trial is a concurrent, mixed methods study. Specifically, the quantitative arm is a multi-centre RCT with four groups (22 factorial design, i.e., LOK absent/present, fPT absent/present) with two periods of post-intervention assessments (immediate and 3 months later). The RCT is linked with an interpretive descriptive qualitative study arm. The three study sites are Holland Bloorview (Toronto, Ontario, Canada), Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) and Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago (Chicago, IL).\n\nParticipants - Children aged 5-18 with CP, GMFCS levels II and III. Inclusion/Exclusion criteria included in protocol in documents section.\n\nRandomization - Following the baseline assessment, participants will be randomly allocated to one of the four groups using computer-generated random sequence.\n\nBlinding Physical therapist assessors and data analysts will be blinded to group allocation.\n\nTreatmentThere are three intervention groups: 1) LOK, 2) LOK + fPT, 3) fPT, and 4) one maintenance therapy control (CONT) arm. All three intervention groups will receive two 50-minute sessions per week, conducted over 8 -10 weeks. Children in all four groups can continue to participate in 'maintenance therapy'. Each child will be assigned to a treatment team of two trained PTs who will share responsibility for the 8 to 10 week intervention phase.\n\nLOK - two 50-minute sessions on the Lokomat® per week. The study manualized LOK walking protocol provides methods for progressing/tracking including a 5-minute over ground walking session after the LOK to facilitate transfer of motor learning from the Lokomat to usual walking devices.\n\nfPT Participants will Two 50-minute sessions per week. The manualized motor-learning based protocol forms the basis for this intervention. Its focus is on balance and multi-plane gait-based motor skills.\n\nLOK + fPT group protocol: Participants will alternate between LOK and one fPT session per week for the duration of the 8 to 10 week intervention phase.\n\nMonitoring co-interventionsMaintenance therapies such as home stretching and strengthening routines can be continued for all 4 groups throughout the study because these therapies have questionable efficacy, and will likely be equally used across all four groups as they are common PT recommendations.\n\nOutcomes - All study outcomes will be measured pre-/post-intervention (< 10 days pre-intervention and post-completion), and at 3m follow-up (+/- 10 day window) by trained physical therapists. Data will be entered into REDCap.\n\nPrimary Outcome - The primary outcome measure is the Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66 Dimensions D (Stand) and E (Walk/Run/Jump).\n\nSecondary Outcomes - Secondary outcomes are measures of walking capacity(6 minute walk test) fitness (adapted shuttle run test), balance (Pediatric Berg Balance Scale, Quality Function Measure (FM), and Activities Balance Confidence Scale), functional abilities (PEDI-CAT), physical activity levels (accelerometry), participation (Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth), physical activity self-efficacy (Self-Efficacy for Physical Activity), individualized goal attainment (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and Goal Attainment Scaling), and quality of life (KidScreen and Students' Life Satisfaction Scale).\n\nStatistical Analysis - Data will be described (e.g., means, standard deviations, frequencies) for each intervention group and each stratification variable. Mixed-effects multiple linear regression models will be developed for each outcome with centre as a random effect, centre by intervention as an interaction (to assess centre effect), and other important variables (e.g., age and GMFCS level) as covariates. All main analyses will be based on intent-to-treat with secondary analyses of those with >80% adherence to their intervention.\n\nQualitative Component\n\nThe three objectives of the concurrent qualitative component are to explicate:\n\nChild and parent experiences with the trial interventions and the values and previous experiences that shape their perceptions.\nThe mobility related outcomes that are important to families and factors that influence these views.\nChild and family values, experiences and contextual factors that influenced participation in the trial, including the follow-up period.\n\nDesign Interpretive description\n\nSample selection- The investigators will invite a subset of child-parent dyads from each of the active interventions in the RCT. In addition, parents of children who were eligible but declined to participate in the RCT will be invited to participate in the qualitative component to address objective #3. The estimated sample size is (i.e., 6 child/parent dyads plus 3 parents from each site).\n\nData Collection - Parents will participate in 45-60 minute semi-structured, individual interviews conducted by one member of the research team. Participating parents of children in the RCT will be interviewed at 2 points within the trial: i) after completion of the COPM and prior to receiving the intervention, and ii) within one month of intervention completion.\n\nChildren from the RCT will participate in individual interviews at the end of their LOK/fPT intervention. A customizable \"tool box\" of age-appropriate child-friendly techniques including photographs and comic captioning, vignettes, and sentence starters will be used in a 30-45 minute semi-structured interview with the child without the parent present.\n\nData Management and Analysis Interviews will be digitally audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim by a professional transcriptionist, de-identified and imported into NVivo for data management. Two researchers will collaboratively identify general coding categories. The researchers will meet to establish consensus on the coding."

          "Fatigue is a major problem in children, adolescents and adults receiving intensive chemotherapy for cancer and in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network suggest that all patients, including children as young as 5 years of age, should be routinely screened for fatigue at the initial visit and at regular intervals throughout and following anti-cancer treatment. These guidelines also suggest that fatigue should be managed according to clinical practice guidelines. However, evidence demonstrating effective interventions for fatigue in children with cancer is scarce. Exercise is an effective intervention for cancer-related fatigue in patients of all ages. However, patients receiving the most intensive treatments may be too ill to participate in a standardized exercise program. A unique and potentially effective intervention that combines exercise and relaxation is yoga. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will determine whether a 3 week program of individualized yoga is associated with less fatigue, better quality of life (QoL) and less systemic opioid use compared to the control program of an Apple tablet (iPad) games, music, movies or books. This is a multi-center, parallel-group, randomized trial of individualized yoga for fatigue. Subjects are inpatients 8-18 years of age receiving intensive chemotherapy for cancer or undergoing HSCT who are expected to remain in hospital for 3 weeks. Participants will be randomized to the individualized yoga program or to the iPad activity control program. For those who remain hospitalized on day 21, the alternate intervention will be offered for 1 week and the preferred strategy will be determined. Yoga has the potential to significantly reduce fatigue, a prevalent and distressing symptom, in children with cancer and HSCT. The investigators have assembled the optimal team with the expertise and track record to accomplish this important trial. This trial is an incremental and critically important step in a program of research designed to improve health for children at the highest risk for poor quality of life. Results may have broad applicability to other hospitalized pediatric populations and has the potential to change in-hospital care for these patients."

          "Background: Fatigue or tiredness is a major problem in children, adolescents and adults receiving intensive chemotherapy for cancer and in those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). While exercise is good for reducing fatigue, these patients are often too sick to participate in regular exercise sessions. A unique, potentially effective type of exercise is individualized yoga. Yoga is particularly good since it can be tailored to be more or less intensive depending on how the child is feeling. The investigators have previously performed a feasibility study of yoga in children admitted to the hospital receiving very intensive chemotherapy or HSCT and found that our program of yoga is doable. The investigators also found children and their parents like the program.\n\nPreliminary Data: The investigators' team completed a feasibility study of yoga in 11 children with cancer or HSCT recipients meeting similar eligibility criteria as the proposed study. In short, these results demonstrated the feasibility of individualized yoga and suggested several design changes to enhance compliance with outcome ascertainment. The investigators found that the mean ± standard deviation for the baseline and day 21 proxy-report PedsQL MFS general fatigue scores were 46.4±26.8 and 55.6±15.5. These scores are much lower compared to fatigue scores observed in two studies of healthy children in which scores of 88.8±12.3 and 89.3±13.3 were described. This data suggest that fatigue is expected to be very severe in our patient population.\n\nObjectives: Primary: To determine if a 3 week program of individualized yoga for hospitalized children receiving intensive chemotherapy is associated with lower general fatigue or tiredness compared to the control intervention of iPad games, music, movies or books. Secondary: To determine if a 3 week program of yoga is associated with better quality of life and less pain medication use when compared to an iPad activity control program.\n\nMethods: This is a multi-center, randomized trial of individualized yoga for fatigue. Participants are children 8-18 years of age receiving intensive chemotherapy for cancer or undergoing HSCT who are expected to remain in hospital for 3 weeks. Participants will be randomized to individualized yoga or to the iPad activity control program. The intervention is an individualized yoga program in which intensity level may change with each session. The control program consists of visits in which games, music, movies or books on a study-supplied iPad will be offered. Yoga sessions will be offered five times a week over 3 weeks and will be led by a trained yoga teacher. In the control arm, the yoga teacher will visit once a day and will offer children games, music, movies or books on an iPad. Fatigue and quality of life will be measured by the parent at baseline, on day 10 and on day 21. For subjects who remain hospitalized on day 21, they will be offered the alternate arm for one week to promote retention.\n\nThe investigators intend to record 20% of yoga and iPad sessions using the iPad to ensure quality control and monitoring of sessions. Recorded files will be downloaded to a secure File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site. Any deviations from the protocol will result in feedback to the site within 1 week of the session and ideally, within 2 days. The research team will also routinely audit the data submitted to ensure completeness of the data submissions.\n\nThe investigators plan to enroll 210 subjects at 2 centres in Canada and 1 centre in the United States over 4 years.\n\nSignificance: Yoga has the potential to significantly reduce fatigue, a prevalent and distressing symptom, in children with cancer and HSCT. The investigators have assembled the optimal team with the expertise and track record to accomplish this important trial. This trial is an incremental and critically important step in a program of research designed to improve health for children at highest risk for poor quality of life. Results may have broad applicability to other hospitalized pediatric populations and has the potential to change in-hospital care for these patients."

          "Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and is a leading cause of emergency medical treatment. For children experiencing an asthma exacerbation, emergency department (ED) guidelines recommend early systemic corticosteroid (CS) administration, since studies have shown associated, time-sensitive, decreases in hospital admissions and ED length-of-stay (LOS). For patients who are treated by 911 emergency medical services (EMS) first, there exists an opportunity for even earlier administration of CS, prior to ED arrival. Yet, preliminary data demonstrate that currently less than 10% of EMS pediatric asthma patients receive CS prior to ED arrival.\n\nGiven the known time-sensitivity of CS' effects on patient outcomes, the investigators hypothesize that even earlier EMS administration of CS will decrease hospital admissions, ED LOS, and intensive care unit admissions for pediatric patients with an acute asthma exacerbation. Using a pragmatic observation stepped wedge design in both Lee County EMS and Nassau County Fire Rescue Department, we will enroll between 300-500 patients over a three-year period o analyze clinical outcomes and comparative costs of EMS CS administration, and how both are influenced by EMS transport time. That novel combination of analyses will help build evidence-based guidelines adaptable for diverse EMS agencies nationwide."

          "The goal of this clinical research study is to determine if there is a difference in time to meet return to sport criteria for Pediatric patients with apophysitis of the knee who receive iontophoresis with Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate (DSP) and Physical Therapy (PT) as those who receive iontophoresis with placebo and PT or PT alone.\n\nApproximately 147 patients will be enrolled in this study."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Iontophoresis is a treatment that allows medication to be delivered across your skin to the painful area without having to have an injection into your muscle or soft tissue, through a vein in your arm, or taking a pill. Instead, liquid medication is placed on a patch (like a large Band-Aid) and then placed on your knee over the location where it hurts. A plastic device, like a battery, is then attached to the patch for three minutes. During this time, this device begins to deliver the medication through your skin and into the area that hurts, and also charges the patch so it can continue to deliver the medication for two hours once the device is removed. The medication is delivered by a mild electrical current. The most common drug used with iontophoresis for pain caused by such things as apophysitis of the knee is dexamethasone sodium phosphate (dexamethasone).\n\nThis is an investigational study. Dexamethasone is a steroid medication that has been approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat many types of problems (such as joint problems, skin and allergy problems, eye, stomach, and lung problems), but has not been approved to treat apophysitis of the knee using iontophoresis. In this study, it is an experimental drug.\n\nParticipants will be randomized to one of three treatment groups:\n\nPhysical therapy with iontophoresis using Dexamethasone\nPhysical therapy with iontophoresis using an inactive drug called a placebo\nPhysical therapy alone\n\nParticipants will be asked to attend study visits twice/week for up to 8 weeks or until they are able to pass the Return To Sport Checklist, whichever is sooner. Participants will the receive a 30-Day Follow Up phone call and complete a survey at the 90-Day mark, making each participant's study duration approximately five (5) months."

        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Background & Rationale:\n\nBackground: Transmission from individuals with pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic (hereafter abbreviated as pre/asymptomatic) SARS-CoV-2 infections is the Achilles' heel of COVID-19 pandemic control1. While pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection is yet to be fully characterized, and generally children are more likely to experience asymptomatic infection or mild disease compared with adults, severe outcomes are possible. Although person-to-person spread is well described in children, as schools have been closed, the transmission risk in that environment remains unknown. More importantly, the contribution of pre/asymptomatic children to overall transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unclear with most pediatric cases linked to a symptomatic household member. According to China's National Health Commission, 130 (78%) of 166 new infections identified on April 1, 2020 were asymptomatic. In addition, data from an adult long-term care facility in Washington indicates that symptom-based screening failed to identify a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, based on RT-PCR cycle threshold values, large quantities of viral RNA were detected in pre/asymptomatic residents, suggesting the potential for transmission regardless of symptoms. Asymptomatic pediatric colonization, while reported, is poorly described.\n\nRationale: SARS-CoV-2 shedding has been noted to occur in minimally symptomatic and asymptomatic infected persons. Children therefore, who appear to more commonly experience mild and asymptomatic infection, may represent a significant risk of household and community transmission. Recommendations for school closures are currently based on assumptions as well as evidence gathered from influenza outbreaks where these measures are known to reduce social contacts and interrupt transmission. School closures, however, disrupt the lives of students and their families and may have negative consequences on child health16. Moreover, COVID-19 transmission modelling studies predict that school closures alone prevent only 2 - 4% of COVID-19-related deaths in the general population, much less than other physical distancing interventions. It should be noted that as school closures were in place before observational studies could begin, the secondary clinical attack rate of pre/asymptomatic children is unknown.\n\nResearch Questions & Objectives:\n\nThe primary objective of this study is quantify the transmission risk posted by SARS-CoV-2 in pre/asymptomatic infected children in order to inform the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic by determining the following:\n\nIf the proportion of household members who develop symptomatic illness over the subsequent 12 days is greater among households of pre/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive children relative to negative children. Mathematical models will be developed to understand the risks associated with other community transmission settings.\n\nIn SARS-CoV-2 positive children, if quantitative viral loads differ between those who become symptomatic relative to those who remain asymptomatic and have secondary household cases.\n\nSecondary aims of this study include the following:\n\nDetermining risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 pre/asymptomatic infection in children.\n\nStudy Design and Methods:\n\nA prospective cohort study, taking place at multiple institutions throughout the United States and Canada, of children brought to the Emergency Department for care due to a condition or illness unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 infection who are tested as part of ongoing local asymptomatic surveillance programs.\n\nFor every SARS-CoV-2-positive asymptomatic child enrolled, three asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-test negative children will also be recruited.\n\nAny child that is tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 who is asymptomatic as part of clinical care, will be potentially eligible for the study. Locally, any child who is tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and who is not displaying any known COVID-19 symptoms will be asked by an Alberta Health Services ED staff member for consent to provide their information to the research team to be contacted about potential participation in the study (consent to contact). Due to testing result timelines and to minimize possible exposure, informed consent/assent will be obtained via telephone and a copy of the consent documentation will be sent via email to the consenting individual, if required. Eligibility for the study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria will be determined over the telephone. Data will be obtained from the participant, their caregiver, and their medical chart, as appropriate. To obtain data related to symptomology, additional medical care, additional testing, and household transmission, a follow up questionnaire will be performed 14 days after the baseline ED visit. If a member of the household is waiting on SARS-CoV-2 testing results at the 14 day follow up time point, an additional call will be made 21 days after the baseline ED visit to obtain SARS-CoV-2 test results. A follow-up call will be performed at 90 days to identify any chronic symptoms that may have developed."

          "Obesity is significantly higher in specific ethnic groups and, in particular, Hispanics. There is an urgent need to implement culturally-sensitive lifestyle interventions and educational programs to decrease the burden of obesity and obesity-related metabolic diseases in Hispanic populations. Accordingly, our overreaching goal is to tailor an existing and successful community-based program, Abriendo Caminos, to leverage effectiveness in promoting healthy nutrition and life-style behaviors among low income, low literacy Hispanic-heritage families. Our multi-function integrated project proposes to (a) adapt Abriendo Caminos for 6-18 year-old children from Mexican and Puerto Rican heritage in five different locations (California, Illinois, Iowa, Puerto Rico, and Texas) and (b) Train existing professionals (in Extension and community agencies) and future professionals (Hispanic university students) to meet the specific needs of this population. Our central hypothesis is that participation in a 6-week community-based program will prevent childhood obesity/maintain healthy weight by significantly increasing: (a) healthy dietary behavior patterns and basic knowledge of nutrition; (b) physical activity levels; and (c) the organization of collective/shared family mealtimes. The implementation of this culturally sensitive, workshop-based curriculum in different regions across the country will help to train the next generation of professionals in Extension and communities to deliver programs that meet the needs of Hispanic families. The integration of Hispanic college students in program implementation via an experiential learning course will further strengthen the program, as well as increase recruitment and retention of Hispanic students, increasing the capacity of Hispanic communities to meet their own needs in the future."

          "The iPeer2Peer Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) study matches youth (12-18 years of age) with SCD to a mentor (trained young adult) who has learned to manage their SCD well, transitioned to adult care, and can support youth participants emotionally and socially. Participants will be randomly assigned one of two groups, either (1) The intervention group: Study group participants are matched with a mentor for 15 weeks, and are expected to have up to ten calls with one another; (2) The control group: This study group will be on a 15 week waitlist to receive a mentor. This study will first assess the feasibility of conducting this research with youth with SCD. Also, this study will assess the preliminary effectiveness of peer mentorship by comparing various health outcomes of the two study groups post-intervention."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a disease affecting red blood cells, where severe pain can develop due to blockage of red blood cells. This the most common genetic blood disease in North America, affecting mostly people of African descent. This type of pain can affect many aspects of one's life, and one's quality of life. Young people with SCD experience pain as they grow from childhood to adulthood, and experience daily chronic pain. There are many negative consequences of SCD, such as anxiety, depression, poor sleep, high stress, and limited social and physical activity. Peer support is a form of support that can provide someone with emotional, informational and social support. Peer support is a promising way of delivering emotional support, while helping someone learn how to cope and manage their disease. This is especially important for chronic diseases such as SCD, because young people will have to learn how to cope and manage their condition while growing up, and for the rest of their lives. A new way to provide face-to-face peer support is through the use of a virtual program using Skype via the Internet (to maintain face-to-face contact between mentors and mentees).\n\nIn this program, a young adult (a mentor) with a chronic disease is matched with a younger person living with the same disease (a mentee) online, through Skype. The mentors are nominated by their healthcare teams, and have successfully transitioned to adult care. They are trained to talk to young people about their disease and can give them some advice on how to manage, and grow up with the condition. This program has been tested with other groups with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and Chronic Pain. A mentor and a mentee are matched for 15 weeks and are encouraged to have up to ten Skype calls together. The investigators do not know how well this program will work with young people with SCD. Therefore, the investigators would like to test out this program to see if it is feasible to conduct the iPeer2Peer SCD program in the future as a larger study with the SCD population.\n\nFeasibility will be measured through the following: (1) recruitment and withdrawal rates; (2) rate of completion of weekly calls; (3) rate of completion of baseline measures; (4) estimates of intervention effects on health outcomes to inform the calculation of an appropriate sample size for the future definitive multi-centred randomized controlled trial (RCT) and (5) participants' perception regarding the acceptability of the SCD iP2P program and their level of engagement with the program (via a semi-structured interview). Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the sample characteristics at baseline. Rates of accrual, drop out, compliance, and missing data with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.To inform sample size calculations and data analysis feasibility for a larger trial, data will be analyzed as in a larger study, and estimates of variance will be calculated. Secondary analysis will be conducted using an intent-to-treat approach. If assumptions for parametric statistics are met, linear regression models will be used to test intervention effects on pain impact, social support, self-efficacy, adherence and HRQL outcomes using an analysis of covariance approach with post-intervention measures compared between groups using baseline scores as covariates. The semi-structured individual (mentees) and focus group (mentors) interviews will determine (i) mentees' acceptability of and level of engagement in the iP2P program and (ii) mentors' likes and dislikes of program, improvement. This data, and subsequent analyses, will be used to refine the iP2P program prior to a full trial. A larger study will help to understand if peer support delivered by a mentor over Skype will help teenagers with SCD better manage their SCD, improve their health outcomes, and ultimately improve their quality of life living with SCD."

          "Background Enoxaparin is a commonly used low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for the treatment of neonatal and children thrombosis that is monitored with anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) levels. However, this therapeutic range of anti-Xa (0.5 - 1.0 u/ml) was extrapolated from adult studies. The burden of pain to neonates due to venipunctures and of resources to the health care system also warrants an evidence-based review to assess the utility of monitoring LMWH therapy with anti-Xa levels.\n\nMethods/Design This is a prospective pilot, feasibility and safety multicenter, randomized controlled trial to compare the approach of treating thrombosis in neonates and children with enoxaparin using weight adjusted fixed dose to variable dose titrated to maintain a pre-determined anti-Xa range (0.5-1.0 u/mL). We plan to recruit 20 neonates and children over the study period, who will be randomized within their first week of anti-coagulation treatment. Key feasibility outcomes include screening/recruitment ratio, monthly recruitment rate, and completeness of data collection. We will also measure the safety outcome of bleeding as well as comment on efficacy of resolution of thrombosis as a secondary outcome.\n\nDiscussion The administration of weight adjusted fixed dose of enoxaparin without anti-Xa monitoring has the potential to reduce pain from multiple venipunctures in neonates and children as well as resources used in their already complex care. The results of the FiXET trial will set the framework for a larger multicenter randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of administering enoxaparin to neonates and children without monitoring to the current conventional approach of routine monitoring with anti-Xa levels."

Key feasibility outcomes include screening/recruitment ratio, monthly recruitment rate, and completeness of data collection. We will also measure the safety outcome of bleeding as well as comment on efficacy of resolution of thrombosis as a secondary outcome.\n\n1.1 Potential Risk and Benefits The administration of weight adjusted fixed dose of enoxaparin without anti-Xa monitoring has the potential to reduce pain from multiple venipunctures in neonates and children as well as resources used in their care. The results of the FiXET trial will provide preliminary clinical data regarding the feasibility and safety of this approach to anticoagulation treatment in neonates and children. It will also provide a preliminary idea about the efficacy of such an approach. This trial, if successful, will set groundwork for a larger multicenter randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of administering enoxaparin to neonates and children without monitoring to the current conventional approach of routine monitoring with anti-Xa levels.\n\nStudy Objectives The aim of this trial is to determine the feasibility and safety of doing a randomized control trial to compare the approach of treating thrombosis in neonates and children with enoxaparin using weight adjusted fixed dose to variable dose titrated to maintain a pre-determined anti-Xa range (0.5-1.0 u/mL).\nEligibility Criteria Four or more tertiary hospitals will participate in this trial. We plan to recruit a total of 20 patients based on the following protocol-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\nStudy Design FiXET trial is a prospective pilot, feasibility and safety multicenter, randomized controlled trial. Recruitment will start following institutional REB approval. This will occur over 1year per centre and may take up to 2 years. Analysis and dissemination will occur after this period of time.\n\n4.1 Study Endpoints\n\nPrimary Objective The primary outcome of this trial is to assess feasibility and safety, as defined below, of administering a weight adjusted fixed dose of enoxaparin to neonates and children with thrombosis.\n\nFeasibility criteria\n\nAt least 5 subjects can be recruited in each participating centre over the study period\nAt least 50% of all approached patients can be recruited\nComplete data collection and follow-up of at least 90% of all recruited subjects\n\nSafety criteria\n\n- No more than 20% of subjects are removed from the study due to 1) low or high anti-Xa levels, or 2) major bleeding\n\nMajor bleeding will be defined as (i) fatal bleeding; (ii) clinically overt bleeding resulting associated with a decrease in hemoglobin of 20 g/L (2 g/dL) in a 24 hour period; (iii) bleeding into a critical organ (intracranial, pulmonary or retroperitoneal); or bleeding requiring surgical intervention [17].\n\nMinor bleeding will be defined as any overt or macroscopic evidence of bleeding that does not fulfill criteria for major bleeding [17].\n\nSecondary Objective Secondary outcome measures include 1) efficacy in resolution of thrombosis; 2) mean anti-Xa levels; 3) number of enoxaparin dose adjustments required in the control arm; and 4) number of venipuncture attempts for blood sampling in patients.\n\nExpected Duration of Participant Participation The duration of enoxaparin therapy will be 6 weeks to 6 months at the discretion of the treating physician."

Early Intensification therapy will be given prior to Consolidation to patients with provisional standard-risk or high-risk ALL/LLy or any provisional low-risk patients with Day 15 MRD ≥1% as well as provisional low-risk LLy patients who do not obtain complete response at the end of Induction. Patients with mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) are treated by using the same treatment stratification used in ALL (B/Myeloid [B/M] MPAL is treated as B-ALL and T/M MPAL is treated as ETP-ALL) although analysis is performed separately from ALL or LLy cohorts.\n\nBrief outline of treatment plan:\n\nPatients will be assigned to treatment based on risk group: Low-Risk, Standard-Risk and High-Risk and cell type (T or B cell).\n\nRemission Induction initially consists of prednisone (28 days), vincristine (4 weekly doses), daunorubicin (1 to 3 weekly doses), and pegaspargase (2 doses). The second part (given over 2 weeks and overlapping with the last week of the first part of induction) consists of cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, and mercaptopurine combinations. Dasatinib will be added for patients with Ph+ and Ph-like ABL1-class fusions and bortezomib will be given to patients with no targetable lesions and Day 15 or Day 22 minimal residual disease (MRD) ≥ 5% on Days 29 and 32.\n\nEarly Intensification will be given prior to Consolidation to patients with provisional standard-risk or high-risk ALL/LLy or any provisional low-risk patients with Day 15 MRD ≥1% as well as provisional low-risk LLy patients who do not obtain complete response at the end of Induction. For patients with Ph-like ALL that is targetable with JAK inhibitor and Day 15 or Day 22 MRD level ≥5% or end of Remission Induction ≥1% as well as all patients with early T cell precursor (ETP) ALL, ruxolitinib will be used. This includes, but is not limited to CRLF2, JAK2, and EPOR rearrangements and sequence/structural changes in JAK1/2, TYK2, IL7R, and SH2B3. Ruxolitinib will be added in LLy patients with activation of JAK-STAT signaling that can be inhibited by ruxolitinib whose responses do not qualify complete response at the end of Remission Induction. Dasatinib will continue for patients with ABL-class fusions. Bortezomib will be added for patients with no targetable lesions and Day 15 or Day 22 MRD ≥ 5% or LLy patients without complete response at the End of Induction.\n\nConsolidation Therapy will consist of high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) (every other week for 4 doses); daily mercaptopurine and IT chemotherapy on the same dates of HDMTX. Dasatinib will continue for patients with ABL-class fusions. Ruxolitinib will continue for patients with activation of JAK-STAT signaling that can be inhibited by ruxolitinib and Day 15 or Day 22 MRD ≥5% or Day 42 MRD ≥1% (or for LLy patients who do not qualify complete response at the end of Remission Induction) and all cases with ETP ALL.\n\nImmunotherapy: CAR T-cell therapy will be considered for High-risk B-ALL and B-LLy patients. Blinatumomab will be given to patients with Standard-risk B-ALL and B-LLy with residual disease at the end of induction and High-risk B-ALL and B-LLy patients who are not able to receive CAR T-cell therapy. Blinatumomab is also given to patients with the following genetic subtypes (BCR-ABL1, JAK-STAT activating mutation, hypodiploid, iAMP21, MEF2D, TCF3/HLF, and BCL2/MYC) or with Down syndrome, regardless of MRD level and/or Total 17 risk category.\n\nReintensification therapy will be offered to certain High-risk patients with persistent MRD after Immunotherapy (B-ALL and B-LLy) or Early Intensification (T-ALL and T-LLy), or those who cannot receive Immunotherapy.\n\nContinuation Treatment will consist of 120 weeks of risk-directed therapy. Dasatinib will continue in patients with ABL1-class fusion. Ruxolitinib will continue in patients with activation of JAK-STAT signaling that can be inhibited by ruxolitinib and Day 15 or Day 22 MRD ≥5% or Day 42 MRD ≥1% (or for LLy patients who do not qualify complete response at the end of Remission Induction) and all cases with ETP ALL. T-ALL and T-LLy patients with leukemia/lymphoma cells in cerebrospinal fluid at diagnosis or MRD ≥0.01% at the end of Induction will receive nelarabine. ALL/LLy Patients with the CEP72 rs904627T/T genotype (16% of patients) will be randomized (unblinded design except those who evaluate neuropathies) to receive either 1.5 mg/m2 or 1 mg/m2 of vincristine after Continuation Week 1. Patients with either a CEP72 rs904627 C/T or C/C genotype (84% of patients) will be randomized to receive vincristine and dexamethasone pulses through Week 49 of Continuation Treatment or through Week 101 of Continuation Treatment.\n\nPatients with mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) are eligible and treatment is given by using the same treatment stratification used in ALL (B/Myeloid [B/M] MPAL is treated as B-ALL and T/M MPAL is treated as ETP ALL) although analysis is performed separately from ALL or LLy cohorts."

          "Effective patient education improves health literacy and engagement thus improving long-term health outcomes. Health literacy is imperative to make informed health decisions and relies on the ability to obtain, process and understand health information; and is the cornerstone of safe health management. It is necessary to evaluate educational initiatives to determine their effectiveness in knowledge translation.\n\nA more effective way to provide patient education is to utilize media technology. Current education styles do not teach patients in the best way as they are not consistent with how people of all ages currently learn (through technology). In addition, patient teaching most commonly occurs during highly stressful times like hospital visits with new diagnoses. Current patient educational methods are costly given the amount of health provider time required.\n\nElectronic KITE teaching modules are infographic visual representations that present information quickly and clearly, integrating words and graphics to tell a story to reveal information. Infographic presentations are tools which facilitate self-directed learning with understandable, accessible information presented in an engaging way with an aim to enhance learning for children and their families. Patients are able to learn at a pace consistent with their learning style to facilitate knowledge development and health literacy."

STK-001 is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that is intended to increase the level of productive SCN1A messenger RNA (mRNA) and consequently increase the expression of the sodium channel Nav1.1 protein. This RNA-based approach is not gene therapy, but rather RNA modulation, as it does not manipulate nor insert genetic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).\n\nSTK-001 is designed to upregulate Nav1.1 protein expression from the nonmutant (wild-type) copy of the SCN1A gene to restore physiological Nav1.1 levels. Nav1.1 levels are reduced in people with Dravet syndrome. Stoke has generated preclinical data demonstrating proof-of-mechanism for STK-001."

        "EligibilityCriteria": [
          "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nInclusion criteria Phase 1 (R/I patients only)\n\nCytogenetic and molecular diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML[2] at either time of initial CML diagnosis or at time of study screening:\n\nCytogenetics must be performed by chromosome banding analysis (CBA) of bone marrow cell metaphases, and requires at least 20 metaphases.\n\nOnly if dividing marrow cells cannot be obtained, or if there is an insufficient number of metaphases, CBA can be substituted by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (IFISH) of bone marrow or peripheral blood cells, using dual color dual fusion probes, that allow the detection of BCR-ABL+ nuclei; at least 200 nuclei should be counted.\n\nQualitative RT-PCR should be performed on RNA extracted from freshly collected bone marrow or peripheral blood cells. It identifies the transcript type, either e14a2 or 13a2 (also known as b3a2 and b2a2), or much more rarely e19a2, or e1a2, indicating the BCRABL protein weight (P210, rarely P230 or P190).\n\nResistance (suboptimal response or failure, as defined by 2013 European Leukemia Net guidelines[3]) or intolerance (with or without suboptimal response or failure) to at least one prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) The 2013 European LeukemiaNet guidelines[3] will be used to define suboptimal response and failure to prior TKI therapy. Details are provided in appendices 3 (intolerance or failure after one TKI) and 4 (Failure after more than one TKIs).\n\nIntolerance to prior TKI therapy will be determined by the treating investigator, but generally applies to patients who are unable to receive standard or reduced doses of a TKI due to significant drug-related toxicity and/or when the drug-related toxicity is not responding to appropriate medical management. Patients who enroll as a result of intolerance to prior TKI therapy may have any level of response to their prior therapy and still be eligible.\n\nAge ≥1 and <18 years at day of attaining the informed consent.\nLansky performance status ≥50% for patients ≤16 years of age, or Karnofsky scale ≥50% for patients >16 years of age (appendix 5).\n\nAdequate bone marrow function:\n\nFor second-line and third-line CP CML patients:\n\nAbsolute neutrophil count >1000/mm3 (>1.0 x109/L); Platelets ≥75,000/mm3 (≥75 x109/L) without any platelet transfusions during the preceding 7 days.\n\nFor fourth-line CP and all for all AP/BP CML patients:\n\nAbsolute neutrophil count >500/mm3 (>0.5 x109/L); Platelets ≥50,000/mm3 (≥50 x109/L) without any platelet transfusions during the preceding 7 days.\n\nAdequate Renal Function: Subjects must have a calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 60mL/min/1.73 m2, using the Schwartz formula to estimate GFR (see appendix 11).\n\nAdequate liver function, including:\n\nAST/ALT ≤2.5 x upper limit normal (ULN) or ≤5 x ULN if attributable to disease involvement of the liver; Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN unless the patient has documented Gilbert syndrome.\n\nRecovered to Grade 0-1, or to baseline, from any acute toxicities of prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, differentiation therapy, or biologic therapy, with the exception of alopecia.\nAble to reliably swallow whole capsules, whole tablets; or drug added to a suitable foodstuff (from capsule contents, added to either apple sauce or yoghurt); or tablets and/or capsules dissolved in water as an oral syringe drinking solution, or tablets dissolved and administered by NG tube when needed.\nSerum/urine pregnancy test (for all girls ≥ age of menarche) negative at screening.\nMale and female patients of childbearing potential and at risk for pregnancy must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception throughout the study and for at least 30 days after the last dose of assigned treatment. A patient is of childbearing potential if, in the opinion of the Investigator, he/she is biologically capable of having children and is sexually active.\nWritten informed consent of parent(s)/legal guardian(s) and/or patients (when applicable depending on age and local law and regulations)\nPatients (including legally acceptable representative for minors where applicable) who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures.\n\nExclusion criteria Phase 1 (R/I patients only)\n\nPatients presenting with any of the following will not be included in the study:\n\nDiagnosis of primary Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\nIn patients with AP/BP CML: leptomeningeal leukemia, defined as positive cytology on lumbar puncture (including both CNS2 and CNS3 status), or clinical symptoms or signs present. This assessment is not required for inclusion of CP CML patients.\nExtramedullary disease only.\nDocumented prior history of T315I or V299L BCR-ABL1 mutations (Note: BCR-ABL1 mutation testing will be performed at screening for a baseline assessment, but results are not used to determine eligibility. This exclusion criterion is based on whether there is a known history of these mutations at the time of study entry. If these mutations become evident during the study the patient will go off study).\nAny prior treatment with a TKI within 7 days prior to starting bosutinib treatment, or other antitumor or anti-leukemia treatment (with the exception of hydroxyurea and/or anagrelide) within 14 days prior to start of bosutinib treatment.\nPrior growth factors or biologic agents within 7 days prior to bosutinib treatment.\nUse of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers (see Appendix 8) within 7 days prior and/or concomitant to bosutinib treatment\nUse of proton pump inhibitors (Ph-modifying agents) within 7 days prior and/or concomitant to bosutinib treatment.\nPrior radiotherapy within 3 months prior to bosutinib treatment.\nAllogeneic stem cell transplantation within 3 months prior to bosutinib treatment.\nDonor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) within 1 month prior to bosutinib treatment.\nHereditary bone marrow failure disorder.\nGraft-versus-host disease (GVHD) within 60 days prior to bosutinib treatment.\nMajor surgery within 14 days prior to bosutinib treatment (recovery from any previous surgery should be complete before day 1).\n\nHistory of clinically significant or uncontrolled cardiac disease, including:\n\nHistory of or active congestive heart failure; Clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia (such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or Torsades de pointes); Diagnosed or suspected congenital or acquired prolonged QT syndrome; History of prolonged QTc.\n\nProlonged QTc (>450 msec, average of triplicate ECGs).\nNeed for medications known to prolong the QT interval.\nPregnant and/or nursing women\nUncorrected hypomagnesemia or hypokalemia due to potential effects on the QT interval.\nLeft ventricular ejection fraction <50% or shortening fraction <28%.\nRecent or ongoing clinically significant gastrointestinal disorder that may interfere with the intake or absorption of the drug.\nEvidence of serious active or uncontrolled bacterial, fungal or viral infection.\nKnown history of hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related illness.\nOther severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.\n\nInclusion criteria Phase 2\n\nResistant/Intolerant CML patients: R/I The inclusion criteria for the R/I patients in Phase 2 are identical to the Phase 1 inclusion criteria.\n\nNewly Diagnosed CML patients\n\nCytogenetic and molecular diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML at either time of initial CML diagnosis or at time of study screening:\n\nCytogenetics must be performed by chromosome banding analysis (CBA) of bone marrow cell metaphases, and requires at least 20 metaphases.\n\nOnly if dividing marrow cells cannot be obtained, or if there is an insufficient number of metaphases, CBA can be substituted by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (IFISH) of bone marrow or peripheral blood cells, using dual color dual fusion probes, that allow the detection of BCR-ABL+ nuclei; at least 200 nuclei should be counted.\n\nQualitative RT-PCR should be performed on RNA extracted from freshly collected bone marrow or peripheral blood cells.

          "The Phase 1 part of the study employs a 6+4 design (no DLT in 6 patients or 1 DLT in 10 patients) and incorporates additional PK information before escalating to the next dose level. If there is unacceptable toxicity or if PK results have exceeded the acceptable exposure levels for the adult equivalent dose, further dose escalation will be prohibited. The Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) is defined as the dose that results in equivalent(approximately ±20% of the adult values) PK exposure to 500 mg/day in adults and with 0 of 6 or <2 DLTs observed out of 10 evaluable patients with Ph+ CML and resistance or intolerance to prior TKI therapy. The phase 2 part of the study will enroll the following patient populations.\n\nNewly diagnosed (ND): newly diagnosed pediatric Ph + CML patients in chronic phase (CP)\nResistant/intolerant (R/I): chronic phase or advanced (accelerated (AP) or blast phase (BP) pediatric Ph+ CML patients with resistance or intolerance to at least 1 prior TKI"

        "BriefSummary": [
          "This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well nirogacestat works in treating patients with desmoid tumors that has grown after at least one form of treatment by mouth or in the vein that cannot be removed by surgery. Nirogacestat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate in patients with progressive, surgically unresectable desmoid tumor treated with nirogacestat.\n\nII. To describe the toxicities of nirogacestat in children and adolescents with desmoid tumor.\n\nIII. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of nirogacestat in children and adolescents.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the objective tumor response rate (ORR) of nirogacestat in children and adolescents with progressive, surgically unresectable desmoid tumor.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To collect blood, archival tumor samples and on-study/post-treatment tumor samples (if available) from patients enrolled on this trial to correlate various CTNNB1 and APC gene mutations and genomic signatures with tumor response and PFS.\n\nII. To explore the effect of nirogacestat on immune cells and immunoglobulin levels in the peripheral blood.\n\nIII. To collect blood samples for banking at baseline, during treatment, and at the time of progression for future research.\n\nIV. To compare assessment of tumor response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, and T2 and volumetric changes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nV. To utilize a tool developed to specifically assess patient reported outcomes (PROs) in adult patients with desmoid tumor (GOunder/DTRF DEsmoid Symptom/Impact Scale [GODDESS]) and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) to explore the relationship between PROs and tumor response and PFS.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive nirogacestat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days."

        "BriefSummary": [
          "The purpose is to evaluate the long-term pathologic weight changes associated with multi-year risperidone or aripiprazole therapy in 3 - <18-year-old children, who have varying durations of prior antipsychotic drug exposure from the start of study Month 0 (M0). This is critical because children appear to have greater vulnerability to antipsychotic-associated weight gain than adults, and obesity has significant effects on morbidity and mortality."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Prospective, multi-site, Phase 4, longitudinal observational study designed to systematically collect robust longitudinal post-marketing safety and quality of life data about multi-year pediatric treatment with risperidone or aripiprazole. Screening may occur for up to 37 days prior to enrollment. Assessments will occur at in-person visits planned at months 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24, and at unscheduled, in-person visits that study staff request when the participant switches or stops antipsychotic monotherapy with risperidone or aripiprazole, adds or stops treatment with a weight modifying agent, becomes pregnant, chooses to withdraw from the study prematurely or, has an ongoing Serious Adverse Event (SAE) that requires further assessment. Monthly remote interim contacts occurring between in-person visits will monitor for changes (other than dose related) in antipsychotic therapy or weight modifying treatments, potential SAEs, and potential pregnancy. The participant, his/her parent/guardian, and the participant's personal psychotropic- prescribing medical provider (PPPMP) will make any and all decisions related to antipsychotic medications; any other medications; and the participant's current mental state, developmental/psychiatric condition, and level of risk for potential harm to self or others independent of the study procedures and assessments. Study staff (SS) will share all lab results and changes in the participant's AEs or clinical presentation, which the study medical clinician (SMC) considers medically concerning based on the participant's assessment during in-person visits, with the participant's PPPMP. If an emergency safety concern is evident during an in-person visit, the SMC will immediately assess the participant, following medical standard-of- care procedures, to determine whether the participant is safe to leave the clinic or requires additional emergency care. If new or worsening symptoms are reported by the participant or parent/guardian during remote interim contacts, the participant and/or parent/guardian will be instructed to contact the PPPMP directly."

          "The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drugs dapagliflozin and saxagliptin in patients with Type 2 Diabetes who are aged 10 to below 18 years old and are currently taking metformin, insulin, or both drugs.\n\nDapagliflozin and saxagliptin are both approved for use in patients with Type 2 Diabetes aged 18 years or older. Dapagliflozin (alone or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs) is available for use in adults in approximately 40 countries worldwide including the USA and Europe. Saxagliptin (alone or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs) is available for use in adults in approximately 90 countries worldwide. This study will assess how well dapagliflozin and saxagliptin work by finding out how these treatments affect blood glucose (sugar) levels compared to placebo (a pill that contains no active drug), in children and adolescents. Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin are considered investigational products in this study since while they have been approved for use in adults (patients 18 years or older), they haven't been approved for children and adolescents due to lack of clinical studies in this specific population.\n\nPatients with Type 2 Diabetes have higher levels of blood glucose (sugar) than patients who do not have this disease. The high level of sugar in the blood can lead to serious short-term and long-term medical problems. The main goal of treating diabetic patients is to lower blood glucose to a normal level. Lowering and controlling blood glucose help prevent or delay complications of diabetes, such as heart disease, kidney, eye and nerve diseases, and the possibility of amputation.\n\nDapagliflozin is a drug that helps to reduce blood glucose (sugar) levels by helping the kidneys to remove excess glucose from the blood and excrete it in the urine. It prevents the kidneys from returning glucose from the urine back into the bloodstream.\n\nSaxagliptin increases insulin production when blood glucose levels are high. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that allows the body to use sugar (glucose) from the food that is eaten for energy or to store glucose for future use. Saxagliptin helps to improve blood sugar levels in response to a meal and between meals if blood glucose levels are not lowered effectively. Saxagliptin does not work when the blood glucose is low. Saxagliptin also helps to decrease the amount of sugar made by the body. Together, these processes reduce blood glucose levels and help to control Type 2 Diabetes.\n\nThe subject will either receive one of the active study drugs or a placebo (a pill that looks identical but contains inactive drug). This study will be double blind; this means that neither the subject, nor the study doctor will know which treatment the subject will receive.\n\nWhich treatment the subject receives is decided by a computer, purely by chance; this is called a \"random assignment\".\n\nFor this study, there will first be a screening phase of up to 6 months if Investigator thinks that some of the screening tests can be repeated, followed by a 2 week lead in phase. Thereafter there will be a 26W short-term treatment phase (W1-26), and a 26 W long-term treatment phase (W27-52). Following this there will be a follow-up telephone call on week 56 and a post study visit at W104. At day 1 visit after the lead in phase the subject will be randomly assigned to receive one of 3 treatments: dapagliflozin 5 mg, saxagliptin 2.5 mg or placebo in a blinded manner. This treatment will continue up to week 14. Then after week 14, and until the end of the study, the subject will be assigned to receive one of the following 5 treatments: dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, saxagliptin 2.5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg or placebo in a blinded manner. The drugs assigned after week 14 will be the same drugs as at Day 1, but some of the groups will receive them at a higher dose.Starting at W32 or W40, i.e., after the end of the primary endpoints, patients with background medication of metformin only, and an HbA1c value < 7.5% at W26 or W32, will undergo a third randomization. Eligible subjects from the treatment arms will undergo the randomized withdrawal of background medication, while eligible patients from the placebo arm will undergo, in addition to randomized withdrawal of background medication a randomized switch to active treatment.\n\nShort- and long-term period study visits can be delayed by a maximum of 11 months in total. If the duration of investigational product administration is longer than 52 (+1) weeks, the safety follow-up period should be shortened such that the complete study duration does not exceed 104 weeks. The W104 visit should not be delayed.If more than 12 weeks elapse between the HbA1c collection at W26 and the third rand at W32, or the HbA1c collection at W32 and the third rand at W40, the subject should not go through this rand as the HbA1c value would no longer be reliable to ascertain eligibility for the third rand"

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "In pediatric Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) subjects on diet and exercise and metformin, or insulin, or metformin and insulin:\n\nThe primary research hypothesis for dapagliflozin is whether addition of dapagliflozin, including up-titration if needed, results in a greater mean reduction from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as compared to placebo when each are administered over 26 weeks of oral double-blind add-on treatment.\n\nThe primary research hypothesis for saxagliptin is whether addition of saxagliptin, including up-titration if needed, results in a greater mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c as compared to placebo when each are administered over 26 weeks of oral double-blind add-on treatment.\n\nStudy Design: The proposed study is a 26-week Phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group study with a 26-week safety extension period to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin (5 mg and 10 mg), and, separately, saxagliptin (2.5 mg and 5 mg) in pediatric subjects with T2DM, and an additional post study visit at Week 104 for assessment of measures of growth and maturity. Approximately 243 pediatric subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive dapagliflozin 5 mg, saxagliptin 2.5 mg, or placebo. Approximately 81 subjects will be randomized to each treatment arm.\n\nAfter a 26-week, double-blind, ST treatment period, the primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed. This will be followed by a 26-week, site- and subject-blind LT safety extension period. Dapagliflozin and, separately, saxagliptin will be compared against the single shared placebo comparator.\n\nMeasures of growth and maturity will be assessed at the Week 104 post study visit.\n\nSubjects will be required to have been treated with diet and exercise and a stable dose of at least 1000 mg metformin (IR or XR) for a minimum of 8 weeks, or a stable baseline dose of insulin for a minimum of 8 weeks, or a stable combination of at least 1000 mg metformin and insulin for a minimum of 8 weeks prior to randomization. At least 50% of subjects will be on a stable baseline dose of metformin, with or without concurrent insulin therapy. At least 30% of total subjects will be between the ages of 10 and 14 years and at least one third, but no more than two thirds, female subjects.\n\nDuring the 2-week lead-in period, subjects will be instructed on a diet and exercise program (in accordance with the American Diabetes Association [ADA] or similar local guidelines) to be followed for the study duration. Subjects will maintain their baseline types and/or doses of antidiabetic therapy throughout the study (2-week lead-in, 26-week double-blind ST treatment period, and the 26-week blinded safety extension LT treatment period). If applicable, investigators will encourage subjects to keep their insulin doses stable. Down-titration of insulin will be allowed only as necessary to prevent hypoglycemia and will be at the discretion of the Investigator. Home glucose meters to monitor glucose control will be dispensed to subjects and self-blood glucose monitoring (SBGM) requirements and procedures will be explained. Subjects will also be instructed on the use of the subject diary to record self-monitored glucose levels and daily insulin dose, if applicable. Subjects will also receive a blood ketone meter for testing when DKA is suspected.\n\nAfter the lead-in period, eligible subjects with HbA1c of 6.5% to 10.5% at screening will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive oral, double-blind, dapagliflozin 5 mg (approximately 81 subjects), saxagliptin 2.5 mg (approximately 81 subjects), or placebo (approximately 81 subjects). Randomization will be stratified based on baseline anti-diabetes treatment regimen (stable baseline dose of metformin (IR or XR), a stable baseline dose of insulin, or a stable combination of metformin and insulin), gender, and age (10 to below 15 years of age, 15 to below 18 years of age).\n\nA blinded HbA1c assessment will be performed at Week 12. All subjects with Week 12 HbA1c values < 7% will remain on previously assigned randomized treatment (dapagliflozin 5 mg, or saxagliptin 2.5 mg, or placebo) after the Week 12 assessment. Subjects assigned to the dapagliflozin treatment arm at Day 1 Randomization with Week 12 HbA1c values >= 7% will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to continue on the low-dose treatment (dapagliflozin 5 mg) or up-titrate to the high-dose treatment (dapagliflozin 10 mg) after the Week 12 assessment. Similarly, subjects assigned to the saxagliptin treatment arm at Day 1 Randomization with Week 12 HbA1c values >= 7% will be re randomized in a 1:1 ratio to continue on the low-dose treatment (saxagliptin 2.5 mg) or up-titrate to the high-dose treatment (saxagliptin 5 mg) after the Week 12 assessment. Subjects assigned to the placebo treatment arm at Day 1 Randomization with Week 12 HbA1c values >= 7% will continue on placebo treatment. To maintain the blinding of treatments as well as HbA1c results, all placebo subjects and all subjects taking saxagliptin or dapagliflozin with an HbA1c < 7% at week 12 will go through a dummy 2nd randomization process that will be indistinguishable (for the subjects and site personnel) from the actual 2nd randomization. During the Week 14 visit, blinded study drug will be dispensed to all subjects in accordance with new treatment assignments based on Week 12 HbA1c assessments. After completion of assessments at Week 26, a subset of eligible subjects who are receiving background medication with metformin only will undergo a third randomization (randomized withdrawal of background medication) at either Week 32 or Week 40. Eligibility for randomized withdrawal from background medication will be restricted to subjects who are receiving background treatment with metformin only, and who have HbA1c < 7.5% at Week 26 or Week 32 provided they have not initiated rescue glycemic control therapy or been withdrawn from study drug. Subjects who are receiving background medication with metformin only, who do not qualify for the third randomization at Week 32 due to an HbA1c ≥ 7.5% at Week 26, may qualify for the third randomization at Week 40 if HbA1c < 7.5% at Week 32. Subjects who have passed Week 40 will not be included in the randomized withdrawal of background medication\n\nAfter completion of the ST treatment period, all subjects will enter the LT treatment period. All subjects, including those randomized to receive placebo, will continue with their randomized study medication assigned after the Week 12 assessment in the site- and subject blind LT treatment period. Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be assessed during a Week 56 phone visit.In case a visit is delayed for any reason, subsequent visits should be scheduled such that an interval of at least 12 weeks is maintained between the:\n\nWeek 14 visit and the Week 26 visit.\nThird randomization (for subjects undergoing third randomization; occurring at the Week 32 or the Week 40 visit) and the Week 52 visit.\n\nIf more than 12 weeks elapse between the HbA1c collection at Week 26 and the third randomization at Week 32, or the HbA1c collection at Week 32 and the third randomization at Week 40, the subject should not go through this randomization as the HbA1c value would no longer be reliable to ascertain eligibility for the third randomization. Short- and long term period study visits can be delayed by a maximum of 11 months in total. If the duration of IP administration is longer than 52 (+1) weeks, the safety follow-up period should be shortened such that the complete study duration does not exceed 104 weeks.\n\nSubjects who discontinue study drug before the end of the study treatment period will enter a non-treatment, follow up phase, in which subjects will follow their visit schedules with modified assessments until study completion. Subjects will attend a post-study visit at Week 104, for assessment of measures of growth and maturity.This visit should be completed without delay (at 104 weeks from Day 1 + 7 days), regardless of whether any other study visits were delayed.\n\nIf scheduled visits at clinical sites will be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., there is a risk that the subject may be exposed to COVID-19 when visiting the site), home visits by study site personnel/vendor are allowed in countries where this is logistically feasible and considered acceptable. Before such a visit, a risk assessment that considers the potential risks to both the subject and the study personnel has to be performed.\n\nDiscontinued subjects will not be replaced. Samples for analysis of plasma levels of dapagliflozin, saxagliptin and its metabolite 5-Hydroxy saxagliptin (5 OH saxagliptin) will be collected pre-dose and approximately 2 hours post-dose (+/- 1 hour) during the Week 6, 12, 20, and 26 visits.\n\nSamples for analysis of plasma glucose will be collected pre-dose during the Day 1 visit, and pre-dose and approximately 2 hours post-dose (+/- 1 hour) during the Week 6, 12, 20, and 26 visits.\n\nPlasma samples for analysis of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) activity will be collected pre-dose during the Day 1 visit, and at 2 (+/-1) hours post-dose during the Week 6, 12, 20, and 26 visits.Samples may be collected at additional time points during the study if warranted and agreed upon between the investigator and the Sponsor, eg, for safety reasons.\n\nAll plasma samples will be drawn in the fasting condition. During the course of the trial, subjects may be eligible for the addition of open-label rescue medication to their blinded treatment regimen in order to treat ongoing hyperglycemia. Insulin may be used as rescue, at the Investigator's discretion.\n\nPre-specified glycemic criteria, based upon self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) FPG, or single central laboratory FPG and repeat confirmatory FPG have been established during the treatment period, starting at Week 6, and up to but not including the Week 52 visit, to determine eligibility for open-label rescue medication.\n\nSample Size:\n\nThe sample size for this study was selected to be consistent with the research hypotheses.\n\nDapagliflozin and saxagliptin will be compared with placebo separately. The Bonferroni method to control the type 1 error rate across two comparisons with respect to the two groups of research hypotheses (dapagliflozin vs placebo and saxagliptin vs placebo) will be used. No comparisons between saxagliptin and dapagliflozin will be performed.\n\nThe sample size for this study is based on the ability to detect a 0.5% improvement over placebo for dapagliflozin and saxagliptin in change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 26 (ST) with at least 80% power for each comparison at a two sided alpha level of 0.025. Assuming a standard deviation of 0.9% for change from baseline HbA1c at Week 26, a total of 237 pediatric subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive dapagliflozin 5 mg (79 subjects), saxagliptin 2.5 mg (79 subjects), or placebo (79 subjects) respectively. Assuming that 2% of subjectsdo not have a primary endpoint, a total of approximately 243 subjects will be randomized. Randomization will be stratified based on the baseline anti-diabetic treatment regimen (stable baseline dose of metformin [IR or XR]), a stable baseline dose of insulin, or a stable combination of metformin [IR or XR] and insulin), gender, and age (10 to below 15 years of age, 15 to below 18 years of age).\n\nThe anticipated difference of 0.5% between each study drug (saxagliptin and dapagliflozin) and placebo used in sample size estimation is consistent with estimates that were obtained in adult clinical trials with saxagliptin or dapagliflozin as add on to anti-diabetic medication where the primary endpoint was improvement in HbA1c after 24 weeks treatment. The standard deviation estimate of 0.9% is consistent with estimates obtained in these adult studies as well as with published estimates from pediatric trials of other anti-diabetic medications.\n\nAnalyses:\n\nDapagliflozin and saxagliptin will be summarized separately. A common placebo group will be included in each summary.\n\nIn addition, within the analyses of saxagliptin, the overall (combined low-dose and high-dose) efficacy and safety analyses will be repeated for the subgroup of subjects on a stable baseline dose of metformin (IR or XR) (with or without insulin). For these analyses, the saxagliptin treatment regimens will be combined into one group and compared to the (common) placebo group. P values corresponding to subgroup comparisons will be reported for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, and will be reported at the nominal significance level.\n\nAll efficacy analyses will be performed using the Randomized Subjects Data Set (all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study medication during the treatment period) unless otherwise specified.\n\nThe following treatment regimens are considered for analysis:\n\nLow-dose/high-dose: Initial treatment of the low-dose followed by up-titrating to the high-dose for those who do not achieve the glycemic target of HbA1c <7% at week 12\nLow-dose: Initial treatment of the low-dose followed by continuing treatment on the low-dose drug for those who do not achieve the glycemic target of HbA1c <7% at week 12 For each drug, the primary comparison between the low-dose/high-dose and placebo regimens will be tested at a two sided alpha level of 0.025.\n\nThe primary efficacy analysis will be performed using a weighted analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Separate models will be used for saxagliptin and dapagliflozin analyses, and each analysis will include the (common) placebo control. Each model will have terms for baseline value, treatment group, and randomization strata.\n\nFor the comparison of the low-dose/high-dose treatment regimen versus placebo, all subjects who had HbA1c<7% at Week 12 and remained on the low-dose will get a weight of one. The subjects who had HbA1c >= 7% at Week 12 and continued on the low-dose will get a weight of 0. The subjects who had HbA1c>= 7% at Week 12 and received the high-dose will have a weight of 2. All subjects who do not undergo the second randomization and all placebo subjects will get a weight of one. The intent-to-treat (ITT) estimand will be evaluated as the primary estimand. Missing values for Week 26 will be imputed using the multiple imputation method. The details of the imputation method will be presented in the statistical analysis plan. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated based on maximum likelihood for the adjusted mean changes within each treatment group as well as for the differences in adjusted mean changes between treatment groups.\n\nTo assess the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis for the change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26, additional sensitivity analysis may be performed using the Evaluable Subjects Data Set if > 10% of the subjects in any treatment group in the Randomized Subjects Data Set have relevant protocol deviations.\n\nThe primary endpoint will also be compared between the low-dose treatment regimen and placebo. In addition, up titrating to high-dose and continuing on low-dose will be compared in the subset of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin subjects who had HbA1c >= 7% at Week 12. These analyses are described under secondary efficacy analyses.\n\nSecondary efficacy analyses will also be performed separately for each drug (saxagliptin and dapagliflozin). For each drug, the following sequential testing order will be employed to control multiplicity of testing for the secondary objectives.\n\nComparison of mean reduction in HbA1c from baseline at Week 26 between the low-dose treatment regimen and placebo\nComparison of mean reduction in HbA1c from baseline at Week 26 between overall drug treatment and placebo\nComparison of mean reduction in FPG from baseline at Week 26 between the low dose/high-dose treatment regimen and placebo\nComparison of mean reduction in FPG from baseline at Week 26 between the low-dose treatment regimen and placebo\nComparison of mean reduction in FPG from baseline at Week 26 between overall drug treatment and placebo\nComparison of the percentage of subjects with baseline HbA1c>= 7% who achieve an HbA1c level < 7.0% at Week 26 between the low-dose/high-dose treatment regimen and placebo\nComparison of the percentage of subjects with baseline HbA1c >= 7% who achieve an HbA1c level < 7.0% at Week 26 between the low-dose treatment regimen and placebo\nComparison of the percentage of subjects with baseline HbA1c >= 7% who achieve an HbA1c level < 7.0% at Week 26 between overall drug treatment and placebo\nComparison of mean reduction in HbA1c from baseline at Week 26 between the high dose and the low-dose in subjects who do not achieve an HbA1c < 7% at Week 12\nComparison of mean reduction in FPG from baseline at Week 26 between the high dose and the low-dose in subjects who do not achieve an HbA1c < 7% at Week 12\nComparison of the percentage of subjects with baseline HbA1c >= 7% who achieve an HbA1c level < 7.0% at Week 26 between the high-dose and the low-dose in subjects who do not achieve an HbA1c < 7% at Week 12 When the sequential testing stops for non-significance, nominal p-values and adjusted means will be provided for the remaining comparisons.\n\nFor each drug, weighted ANCOVA analysis will be performed for the change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 26 to compare the placebo and the low-dose treatment regimen. For this analysis, all subjects who had HbA1c < 7% at Week 12 and remained on the low-dose will get a weight of one. The subjects who had HbA1c >= 7% at Week 12 and continued on the low-dose will get a weight of 2. The subjects who had HbA1c >= 7% at Week 12 and received the high-dose will have a weight of 0. All subjects who do not undergo the second randomization and all placebo subjects will get a weight of one.\n\nFor subjects on saxagliptin and dapagliflozin and who had HbA1c >= 7% at Week 12, the change from baseline HbA1c at Week 26 (ST) will be compared between the subjects re-randomized to remain on the low-dose and the subjects who are re-randomized to the high- dose using an ANCOVA.\n\nChange from baseline of HbA1c at Week 26 (ST) will be compared also using a repeated measures analysis between overall drug and placebo. For this analysis, both treatment regimens will be combined into one treatment group for each drug.\n\nChange from baseline at Week 26 (ST) in FPG will be analyzed similar to the primary weighted analyses of change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 26.\n\nThe proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c < 7.0% at Week 26 (ST) will be analyzed using weighted logistic regression with adjustment for the baseline HbA1c measurement and the randomization strata. Weighting for the subjects will be applied similarly to a weighting in the analysis of change from baseline in HbA1c. Subjects with missing a response at Week 26 will be imputed by dichotomizing the imputed values of HbA1c at Week 26.\n\nThe assessment of safety will be based on the analyses of AEs, vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, hypoglycemia, DKA, safety laboratory evaluations, and measures of growth and maturity. All safety analyses will be performed using the Treated Subjects Data Set. Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin will be summarized separately. Treatment regimens (low-dose or low-dose/high-dose) will be combined for saxagliptin and dapagliflozin to provide the safety summary for overall saxagliptin and overall dapagliflozin compared to placebo. A common placebo group will be included in each summary.\n\nMeasures of growth, bone and maturation markers will also be summarized for the combined ST + LT + additional post study visit at Week 104.\n\nMonitoring The Sponsor/designee representatives will review data centrally to identify potential issues to determine a schedule of on-site visits for targeted review of study records.\n\nRepresentatives of the Sponsor (or designee) must be allowed to visit all study site locations periodically to assess the data quality and study integrity. On site they will review study records and directly compare them with source documents, discuss the conduct of the study with the Investigator, and verify that the facilities remain acceptable.Off-site monitoring visits and remote source data verification are allowed when restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic prevent on site visits (e.g., monitors may not be able to access the sites in a timely manner). Should this occur, it should be documented and the reasons be available for review by the Sponsor and during inspections by any Regulatory Authorities In addition, the study may be evaluated by the Sponsor (or designee) internal auditors and government inspectors who must be allowed access to Case Report Forms (CRFs), source documents, other study files, and study facilities. The Sponsor (or designee) audit reports will be kept confidential.\n\nThe investigator must notify the Sponsor (or designee) promptly of any inspections scheduled by regulatory authorities, and promptly forward copies of inspection reports to the Sponsor/designee.\n\nRecords Retention The investigator must retain all study records and source documents for the maximum period required by applicable regulations and guidelines, or institution procedures, or for the period specified by the Sponsor/designee, whichever is longer. The investigator must contact the Sponsor/designee prior to destroying any records associated with the study.\n\nThe Sponsor/designee will notify the Investigator when the study records are no longer needed.\n\nIf the Investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retirement), the records shall be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (e.g., another investigator, IRB). Notice of such transfer will be given in writing to the Sponsor/designee.\n\nStudy Drug Records\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that a current disposition record of study drug (inventoried and dispensed) is maintained at the study site to include Investigational Products (IPs). Except where the IP has to be sent directly to the subjects' homes due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic. Any unused IP sent directly to subjects' homes should be returned to the site at the next on-site visit.Records or logs must comply with applicable regulations and guidelines and should include:\n\nAmount received and placed in storage area\nAmount currently in storage area\nLabel identification number or batch number\nAmount dispensed to and returned by each subject, including unique subject identifiers\nAmount transferred to another area/site for dispensing or storage\nNon study disposition (e.g., lost, wasted)\nAmount destroyed at study site, if applicable\nAmount returned to the Sponsor/designee\nRetain samples for bioavailability/bioequivalence, if applicable\nDates and initials of person responsible for IP dispensing/accountability, as per the Delegation of Authority Form The Sponsor/designee will provide forms to facilitate inventory control if the investigational site does not have an established system that meets these requirements.\n\nCase Report Forms An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each individual treated or entered as a control in the investigation. Data that are derived from source documents and reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. Additional clinical information may be collected and analyzed in an effort to enhance understanding of product safety. Case report forms may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported or identified during the course of the study.\n\nFor sites using the Sponsor/designee's Electronic Data Capture (EDC) tool, electronic CRFs will be prepared for all data collection fields except for fields specific to SAEs and pregnancy, which will be reported on the electronic SAE form and Pregnancy Surveillance Form, respectively. If electronic SAE form is not available, a paper SAE form can be used. Spaces may be left blank only in those circumstances permitted by study-specific CRF completion guidelines provided by the Sponsor/designee.\n\nThe confidentiality of records that could identify subjects must be protected, respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s).\n\nThe investigator will maintain a signature sheet to document signatures and initials of all persons authorized to make entries and/or corrections on CRFs.\n\nThe completed CRF, including any paper or electronic SAE/pregnancy CRFs, must be promptly reviewed, signed, and dated by the Investigator or qualified physician who is a co-investigator and who is delegated this task on the Delegation of Authority Form. For electronic CRFs, review and approval/signature is completed electronically through the Sponsor/designee's EDC tool. The investigator must retain a copy of the CRFs including records of the changes and corrections.Data entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained.\n\nEach individual electronically signing electronic CRFs must meet Sponsor/designee training requirements and must only access the Sponsor/designee's EDC tool using the unique user account provided by the Sponsor/designee. User accounts are not to be shared or reassigned to other individuals."

          "All patients 18 years of age or younger who have completed an initial medical assessment between March 1, 2014 through April 30, 2020 will be approached for this study.\n\nData from individual follow up visits or group intervention sessions, depending on the program design of each institution, will be collected through October 31, 2020. The data included in this study will be collected during routine medical care. Information that could identify a participant will be removed from the data. Data will be entered into a secure database called Medidata Rave® CDMS. This database will be managed by the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC).\n\nThe DCC will combine all the data from each site. Additional data cleaning and data quality monitoring will be performed. Combined datasets for analysis will be provided by the DCC in a format agreed upon by the POWER Governance Board. Data will be stored in a secure and protected format and will not include any written or electronic protected health information (PHI/EPHI). The DCC will store the data on a secure server."

Exception: Subjects for whom the potential benefits of participating in the study outweigh the potential risks of thromboembolic events, as determined by the investigator.\nBaseline ophthalmic problems that may potentiate cataract development\n\nImpaired cardiac function, such as:\n\nKnown prolonged QTc, with corrected QTc >450 msec\nOther clinically significant cardio-vascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension, history of labile hypertension),\nHistory of known structural abnormalities (e.g. cardiomyopathy).\n\nHistory or current diagnosis of cardiac disease indicating significant risk of safety for patients participating in the study such as uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease, including any of the following:\n\nRecent myocardial infarction (within last 6 months),\nUncontrolled congestive heart failure,\nUnstable angina (within last 6 months),\nClinically significant (symptomatic) cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., sustained ventricular tachycardia, and clinically significant second or third degree AV block without a pacemaker.)\nLong QT syndrome, family history of idiopathic sudden death, congenital long QT syndrome or additional risk factors for cardiac repolarization abnormality, as determined by the investigator.\nKnown immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction to eltrombopag or its excipient.\n\nPregnant, breastfeeding, or unwilling to practice birth control during participation in the study. Women of childbearing potential (have achieved menarche) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test and agree to use basic methods of contraception (if sexually active) or maintain abstinence for the duration of the study. Basic contraception methods include:\n\nTotal abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\nFemale sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment\nMale sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject\nBarrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap. For the UK: with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository\nUse of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate <1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.\nMale patients who are sexually active and do not agree to abstinence or to use a condom during intercourse while taking eltrombopag, and for 7 days after stopping treatment.\nHistory of alcohol/drug abuse\nPresence of a medical condition that in the opinion of the Investigator would compromise the safety of the patient or the quality of the data.\nConcurrent participation in an investigational study within 30 days prior to enrollment or within 5-half-lives of the investigational product, whichever is longer. Note: parallel enrollment in a non-therapeutic trial such as disease registry or biology study is permitted.\n\nOther Eligibility Criteria Considerations All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent (and assent when applicable)\n\nPatients and/or parents who are unable to read English at a grade 2 level will be excluded from the patient-reported outcome component of the study.

When appropriate, younger patients will be included in all discussions in order to obtain assent.\nAdequate organ function: Patients should have adequate hepatic, renal, cardiac and pulmonary function to undergo reduced intensity HCT based upon local institutional guidelines, or at a minimum meet requirements noted in eligibility checklist Appendix A-VIII_1. However, significant hepatic and pulmonary dysfunction, if secondary to underlying LCH disease activity, will not exclude patients from protocol enrollment and should be discussed with the National PI Coordinator and the Coordinating Principal Investigator.\n\nStratum V\n\nAll patients with verified diagnosis of LCH and MRI findings consistent with ND-CNSLCH irrespective of previous treatments (also those not registered to other Strata ofLCH-IV).\nPatients with isolated tumorous CNS-LCH (including isolated DI with mass lesion in the hypothalamus-pituitary axis). In patients with already established diagnosis of LCH and radiologic finding of CNS lesions compatible with LCH, a biopsy of the lesion is not obligatory. In all other cases a biopsy of the lesion is needed for inclusion into the study\n\nStratum VI\n\n-- Patients with newly diagnosed SS-LCH and localization other than \"multifocal bone\",isolated tumorous CNS lesion, or isolated \"CNS-risk\" lesion.\n\nStratum VII -- All patients registered in LCH IV (regardless of treatment) as long as consent for longterm follow-up has not been withheld.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nStratum I\n\nPregnancy (patients of child-bearing age must be appropriately tested before chemotherapy)\nLCH-related permanent consequences (e.g. vertebra plana, sclerosing cholangitis, lung fibrosis, etc.) in the absence of active disease\nPrior systemic therapy\n\nStratum II\n\nPatients with progressive disease in risk organs\nPermanent consequences (e.g. sclerosing cholangitis, lung fibrosis, etc.) without evidence of active LCH in the same organ or in any other locations\nNo written consent of the patient or his/her parents or legal guardian\n\nStratum III\n\nThe presence of any of the following criteria will exclude the patient from the study:\nIsolated sclerosing cholangitis without evidence of active hepatic LCH as the only evidence of risk organ involvement.\nInadequate renal function as defined by serum creatinine > 3x normal for age\n\nStratum IV\n\nPulmonary failure (requiring mechanical ventilation) not due to active LCH.\nIsolated liver sclerosis or pulmonary fibrosis, without active LCH.\nUncontrolled active life-threatening infection.\nDecreased renal function with a GFR of less than 50ml/1.73m2/min.\nPregnancy or active breast feeding\nFailure to provide signed informed consent\n\nStratum VI\n\nPatients with SS-LCH who have an isolated tumorous CNS lesion (they are eligible for Stratum V),\nPatients with isolated \"CNS-risk\" or multifocal bone lesions (they are eligible for Stratum I, Group 2)"

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "The international efforts of the past 20 years have shown that combination therapy with vinblastine and prednisone is an effective therapy for Multi-system (MS)-LCH. The previous prospective trial LCH-III confirmed this regimen as a standard regimen for MS-LCH in patients with and without risk organ involvement. It also showed that prolonged treatment in the latter group (treatment duration of 12 vs. 6 months) is superior in preventing disease reactivations. The results of this trial are encouraging and serve as a basis for the LCH-IV study design.Due to the complexity of the disease presentations and outcomes, the LCH-IV study seeks to tailor treatment based on features at presentation and on response to treatment, leading to seven strata:\n\nStratum I: First-line treatment for MS-LCH patients (Group 1) and patients with Single system (SS)-LCH with multifocal bone or \"Central Nervous System (CNS)-risk\" lesions (Group 2)\nStratum II: Second-line treatment for non-risk patients (patients without risk organ involvement who fail first-line therapy or have a reactivation after completion of first-line therapy)\nStratum III: Salvage treatment for risk LCH (patients with dysfunction of risk organs who fail first-line therapy)\nStratum IV: Stem cell transplantation for risk LCH (patients with dysfunction of risk organs who fail first-line therapy)\nStratum V: Monitoring and treatment of isolated tumorous and neurodegenerative CNS-LCH\nStratum VI: Natural history and management of \"other\" SS-LCH (patients who do not need systemic therapy at the time of diagnosis)\nStratum VII: Long-term Follow up (all patients irrespective of previous therapy will be followed for reactivation or permanent consequences once complete disease resolution has been achieved and the respective protocol treatment completed)"

        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Advances in immunosuppressive regimens have significantly improved short-term allograft survival for kidney transplant recipients. Yet, long-term allograft survival remains static. For children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), improvements in long-term outcomes are greatly needed. Children with ESRD require multiple transplants over a lifetime, incurring repeated surgical and immunological risks with each newly transplanted organ. Allograft injury occurs primarily due to acute cellular rejection (ACR) and/or antibody mediated rejection (AMR) and viral infections, such as BK virus associated nephropathy (BKVN). A major hindrance to promoting long-term allograft survival is the lack of non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to reliably detect early injury in the allograft before clinical manifestations arise.\n\nThe incidence of acute rejection (AR) in children in the first year post-transplant is 10-13%[1]. The current gold standard for diagnosing AR is core needle biopsy; however, biopsy is highly invasive, incurs risk of bleeding and graft loss, is subject to sampling error and lacks sensitivity and specificity for early injury. Since immune responses are dynamic over time, single biopsies do not adequately capture anti-allograft immunity, but repeat biopsies are impractical in children who often require sedation and hospitalization for biopsies. Other markers, such as serum creatinine, have low sensitivity and specificity for early kidney allograft damage.\n\nThe ability to identify sub-clinical kidney allograft injury using minimally invasive, robust, biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity in pediatric recipients would represent a major advance in pediatric kidney transplant care. In the Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation (CTOT)-04 study, a NIH-sponsored, multicenter, prospective study of adult kidney allograft recipients, members of the VIRTUUS team were able to diagnose and predict ACR using urinary cell mRNA and metabolite profiles with high sensitivity and specificity[2, 3]. In addition, the investigators validated a urinary cell mRNA signature that distinguishes acute rejection (AR) from acute tubular injury (ATI) and ACR from AMR as well as a urinary cell mRNA signature diagnostic and prognostic of BKVN[3-5]. The overarching objective of this VIRTUUS proposal is to adapt existing validated adult noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to characterize allograft status in pediatric recipients of kidney allografts. Specifically, the investigators will investigate 1) whether the adult urinary cell 3-gene signature is diagnostic and prognostic of ACR in pediatric recipients of kidney allografts, 2) whether the combined metabolite and the urinary cell 3-gene signature is diagnostic and prognostic of ACR in pediatric recipients of kidney allografts, 3) whether levels of BKV VP-1 mRNA in urinary cells are diagnostic of BKVN, and 4) whether urinary cell levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor -1 (PAI-1) mRNA and serum creatinine levels predict allograft failure.\n\nInvestigators propose to validate early immunologic markers that have shown to be prognostic and diagnostic in adult kidney transplant recipients in pediatric kidney transplant recipients. Investigator findings will significantly advance the field of pediatric transplantation by moving toward proactive, tailored immunosuppressive regimens that minimize morbidity and optimize long-term allograft survival.\n\nThe Investigator's primary objective is to hypothesize that: (i) the adult urinary cell 3-gene signature will be diagnostic and prognostic of ACR in longitudinally collected urine samples from children with kidney transplants; and (ii) combined metabolite and mRNA biomarkers have greater ability to diagnose ACR than the mRNA or metabolite signature alone and (iii) levels of BKV VP-1 mRNA are diagnostic of BK virus nephropathy (BKVN) and (iv) urinary cell levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) mRNA and serum creatinine levels predict allograft failure.\n\nInvestigators seek to:\n\nDetermine if the adult urinary cell 3-gene signature is diagnostic and prognostic of ACR in pediatric kidney allograft recipients,\nEvaluate whether a combined metabolite and the 3-gene urinary mRNA signature is diagnostic and prognostic of ACR and\nTest the hypothesis that BKV-VP-1 mRNA levels in urinary cells are diagnostic of BKVN, and to test the hypothesis that a two variable prediction model composed of urinary cell level of PAI-1 mRNA and serum creatinine levels, both measured at the time of BKVN biopsy diagnosis, predict future graft failure\n\nSecondary objectives include the following:\n\nCreate a repository of DNA samples from urine, saliva, discarded blood and tissue, and deceased donor blood and tissue to use for future research studies that will examine genome-wide associations with rejection and viral infections in pediatric kidney transplant recipients and\nCreate a biobank of samples of left-over blood and deceased donor blood to later examine associations between urine and blood proteomics and metabolomics."

The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants in the tailored arm who did not take any oral antibiotics in the 28 days following randomization.\n\nUltimately, we want to learn:\n\nWhat is the best way to treat pulmonary exacerbations?\nShould everyone with a pulmonary exacerbation take antibiotics?\nDo the benefits of starting antibiotics at the first signs of illness outweigh the possible risks, like side effects and antibiotic resistance?\n\nThis pilot study is designed to determine if an interventional study to help answer these questions is feasible. Up to 120 participants will be enrolled and followed through their well state of health, then for 28 days following their first randomized exacerbation. Enrollment will stop after 80 pulmonary exacerbation events have been randomized, even if this does not require 120 participants. Due to the nature of the study, the identity of treatment assignment will be known to investigators, research staff, and patients (ie, not blinded).\n\nTotal duration of this pilot study is expected to be approximately 18 months: 6 months for participant recruitment and 12 months for follow up. Participants could be monitored for up to 18 months if they do not have an exacerbation. However, it is anticipated that the majority of participants will experience a randomizable PEx event and therefore have a shorter follow up period."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "SHPT is a common and serious co-morbidity that develops relatively early in the course of CKD, worsens with declining kidney function, and is associated with serious complications in children on dialysis. Children on dialysis experience a wide spectrum of bone abnormalities and growth retardation, in addition to increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that manifests early in their adulthood. Traditional therapies for SHPT (eg, vitamin D sterols) are widely used in the pediatric dialysis population, and have the potential to aggravate complications of the disease by increasing serum calcium (Ca), serum phosphorus, and serum Ca times serum phosphorus product.\n\nEtelcalcetide has been shown to be safe and efficacious in treating adult CKD patients with SHPT by simultaneously controlling intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), Ca, and phosphorus and has recently been approved for use in adult patients with SHPT treated with hemodialysis in both the United States and Europe. Although no previous studies have been conducted in pediatric patients with etelcalcetide (one single dose pharmacokinetic [PK] study is currently ongoing), Amgen anticipates minimal to moderate risk with a possibility of direct benefit to the pediatric subject in this study. The burden of complications of SHPT in the pediatric dialysis population and the limitations of current standard therapy, underscore the need for studies of etelcalcetide in these patients to address this unmet medical need and inform the pediatric nephrology community of the potential use of etelcalcetide in children on hemodialysis with critical safety and efficacy data."

          "The Kids FACE FEARS (Kids Face-to-face And Computer-Enhanced Formats Effectiveness study for Anxiety and Related Symptoms) is a large pragmatic comparative effectiveness study evaluating face-to-face (therapist led office based or telehealth) vs. self-administered online cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of child and adolescent anxiety. Families will be recruited from pediatric health centers serving primarily racial/ethnic minority youth in urban, suburban, and semi-rural regions. Patient-centered outcomes will be evaluated across a one-year follow-up period; parents, patients, providers, and other key stakeholders will be actively engaged throughout all aspects of the research."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Anxiety disorders are among the most common and impairing psychiatric disorders to affect children and adolescents. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an effective psychological treatment for youth anxiety, with roughly 60-80% of youth showing considerable clinical response and global improvements in functioning. Regrettably, despite the existence of well-supported treatments, most youth with anxiety disorders do not receive any form of treatment, especially in resource poor settings. The pediatric health care setting offers an optimal public health venue for youth anxiety management, yet there is a critical lack of behavioral health specialty care providers who are trained in providing mental health treatment, and a lack of information on the optimal methods of treating anxiety in pediatric settings. Two evidence-based strategies for delivering CBT for youth with mild to moderate anxiety in pediatric settings are (1) face-to-face CBT delivered by therapists within pediatric health care in an office-based setting or via telehealth and (2) online delivery of CBT skills to youth and families. Importantly, however, there are no data on the relative effectiveness of these two treatment formats in real-world settings, and no information on which patient subgroups benefit most from which formats in patients in real-world practice.\n\nThe study design entails a large-scale, streamlined, pragmatic, Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), in which eligible anxious youth presenting to pediatric primary care settings will be randomly assigned to face-to-face versus online Cool Kids suite of CBT intervention for youth anxiety and monitored for up to one year post-intervention. Outcomes for each participant will be monitored across four assessment points, corresponding to baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 1 year post-baseline. Long-term outcomes associated with face-to-face versus online CBT will be evaluated over a 1-year period post-intervention. We will use the well-established Cool Kids suite of face-to-face and online anxiety CBT protocols within pediatric primary care networks serving primarily racial-ethnic minority children in both urban and rural settings across four regions of the US: the Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast, and the Pacific Northwest. Therapists embedded within pediatric primary care settings and mental health clinics co-located with primary care will provide all services. All participants will be identified and referred for enrollment from pediatric health settings.\n\nThis study addresses three critical yet unanswered questions related to improving the delivery of treatment and outcomes for anxiety in pediatric primary care. Answering the following question offers the potential to meaningfully improve the quality of the evidence available to help children, families, and organizational stakeholders make informed decisions regarding clinical practice and implementation strategies for the treatment of childhood anxiety:\n\nWhat is the relative effectiveness of implementing therapist-led face-to-face (office based or telehealth) versus online formats of CBT to treat youth anxiety in pediatric health settings?\nHow do factors such as clinical severity, treatment preference, socioeconomic status, computer literacy, distance to clinic, organizational readiness, or medical home status moderate outcomes across treatment formats? Which patient subgroups might benefit most from which formats and sequences of treatment?\nWhat are the barriers and facilitators to delivering this care in pediatric health settings and for the diverse patient populations served?"

          "Background: Children with severe cerebral palsy (CP) are at high risk for dislocating their hips. These hips are associated with contractures and pain, which can interfere with care-giving, seating, positioning, mobility and quality of life. The primary purpose of this project (Aim 2) is to evaluate the effectiveness of different intervention strategies to prevent or relieve the symptoms associated with hip instability in children with severe non-ambulatory CP, using the validated Caregiver Priorities and Child Health Index of Life with Disabilities (CPCHILD©) questionnaire as the primary outcome measure of health related quality of life (HRQL) for this population. Secondarily, this project will also measure the impact of hip displacement on HRQL of these children. This project will be the first of its kind and this scale, which will systematically study the impact of hip instability and its management in children with severe CP, using a meaningful outcome measure that was developed specifically for this purpose. The international network of investigators/sites and the infrastructure established for this project will facilitate the long term follow-up of the participants in this study, as well as the conduct of other multi-centre clinical trials and cohort studies to evaluate the effectiveness of current and future interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of children with severe disabilities.\n\nStudy Design & Participants: International multi-centre prospective longitudinal cohort study of children with severe (non-ambulant) cerebral palsy (GMFCS levels IV & V) from ages 3 to 18 who have radiographic evidence of hip displacement [Reimer's Migration Percentage (MP) ≥ 30%].\n\nMeasures: Detailed demographic information, and prognostic factors, including co-morbid conditions will be recorded at baseline, in addition to self-administered parental reports of HRQL as measured by the CPCHILD. Hip status will be classified using standardized radiographic measures of Reimer's MP and acetabular index (AI). The primary outcome measure CPCHILD, as well as the MP & AI will be measured at 6, 12 and 24 months following initial intervention.\n\nAim 1: Measure the impact of increasing hip displacement in children with severe (non-ambulant) CP on their HRQL as measured by the CPCHILD questionnaire.\n\nAim 2: (Primary Purpose): Measure the effectiveness of different strategies of interventions for hip displacement in children with severe (non-ambulant) CP in a prospective longitudinal comparative cohort study using the CPCHILD as the primary outcome measure of HRQL.\n\nAim 3: Compare the types and rates of adverse events and complications associated with each of the treatment cohorts.\n\nMethods: Observational study of usual (site/surgeon specific) clinical practice. Investigators at each site will enroll eligible participants and assign each to one of the following 5 cohorts based on individual treating doctor's &/or parental preferences:\n\nA. \"Natural\" history or watchful waiting (N=100)\n\nB. Serial botulinum toxin injections +/- abduction bracing (N=100)\n\nC. Adductor (+/- psoas) muscle releases alone (N=100)\n\nD. Hip reconstructive surgery (N=100)\n\nE. Salvage hip surgery (N=100)\n\nThe baseline MP and CPCHILD scores for all participants will be analyzed cross-sectionally to evaluate the correlation between hip displacement and the CPCHILD scores to serve Aim 1. For Aim 2, children undergoing interventions for hip instability (Groups B, C, D, & E) will be compared with each other as well as with their respective matched counterparts of untreated children (Group A), using repeated measures of analysis of covariance (ANOCOVA) to measure the mean change in scores from baseline at 6, 12 and 24 months after intervention.\n\nTimelines: 500 participants will be recruited in 24 months, and followed for 24 months. The analysis, reporting of results, manuscript development and knowledge transfer will take 12 months. In total, the study will take 5 years to complete."

          "The Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network (HCRN) has been established by philanthropic funding to conduct multi-institutional research (clinical trials and observational studies) on pediatric hydrocephalus. In addition to philanthropic funding, the HCRN has also received an NIH NINDS Challenge Grant to support the network infrastructure which allows for the conduct of this and other network studies. The HCRN consists of multiple Clinical Centers and the Data Coordinating Center (DCC). The HCRN Core Data Project will obtain data about all neurosurgical hydrocephalus events from the network Clinical Centers, and create a database to be used by HCRN investigators. The ongoing maintenance of the Core Data Project serves two main purposes: 1) it will help investigators understand the variability, progression, and current treatment practices for hydrocephalus in children, with an ultimate goal of better guiding and assessing therapeutic intervention and providing recommendations on patient care and, 2) it will provide pilot and descriptive data necessary for hypothesis generation and study design (i.e. preliminary power analyses, recruitment projections) for studies under development by the HCRN. This multi-institutional database will be maintained throughout the lifetime of the HCRN, and may be useful for tracking trends in pediatric hydrocephalus over time. The Core Data Project will be an invaluable resource to the HCRN and will help stimulate new research protocols, identify potential need for future expansion of the network to incorporate additional patient populations, and provide a descriptive understanding of children with hydrocephalus cared for within the network."

          "Investigators from eight tertiary care, level 1 pediatric trauma centers have developed a protocol for the establishment of a formal, prospective multi-center adolescent clavicle registry, with designs for standardized radiographic assessment and the prospective collection of validated outcome measures and complications data, for all patients, ages 10-18, treated for clavicle shaft fractures, operatively and non-operatively. Eventually, the investigators would like to do comparative analysis for the operative and non-operative treatment arms, with additional sub-stratified analyses performed within these treatment arms by age and activity level. Among the primary goals of research projects stemming from the first arm of this registry, FACTS A, is to explore the hypothesis that non-operative treatment is associated with lower costs, greater safety, and equivalent or superior outcomes, compared with operative treatment, despite a national trend towards increasing surgical treatment. The second arm of the registry, FACTS B, will continue to investigate the same hypotheses, excluding cost outcomes, in patients only with completely displaced midshaft clavicle fractures."

          "This is a multicenter, open-label, seven arm, dose escalation, phase I study of oral ONC201 in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) and recurrent/refractory H3 K27M gliomas. Arm A will define the RP2D for single agent ONC201 in pediatric patients with glioma who are positive for the H3 K27M mutation (positive testing in CLIA laboratory) and have completed at least one line of prior therapy. This will allow for recurrent patients and also patients who have not yet recurred, but have completed radiation and will inevitably recur based on prior clinical experience and the literature. Arm B will define the RP2D for ONC201 in combination with radiation in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed DIPG. Arm C will determine intratumoral drug concentrations and biomarker expression in pediatric patients with midline gliomas. Arm D will determine H3 K27M DNA levels and drug concentrations in the CSF of pediatric H3 K27M-mutant glioma patients. Arm E will determine the RP2D for single agent ONC201 administered as a liquid formulation in Ora-Sweet to patients with DIPG and/or H3 K27M glioma. Arm F is a dose expansion cohort to confirm the safety and estimate the efficacy in recurrent H3 K27M-mutant glioma population at the RP2D. Arm G will define the RP2D for single agent ONC201 given on two consecutive days of each week in pediatric patients with glioma who are positive for the H3 K27M mutation and have completed at least one line of prior therapy."

          "CP (cerebral palsy) refers to a group of neurological disorders that appear in infancy or early childhood and permanently affect body movement and muscle coordination. CP is caused by damage to or abnormalities inside the developing brain that disrupt the brain's ability to control movement and maintain posture and balance. The signs of CP usually appear in the early months of life, although specific diagnosis may be delayed until the age of 2 years or older. TEV-50717 (deutetrabenazine, also known as SD-809) has already provided evidence for safe and effective use in 2 other hyperkinetic movement disorders, namely chorea in Huntington's disease (HD) and tardive dyskinesia (TD). Currently, there is no approved treatment available for Dyskinesia in cerebral palsy (DCP). The available treatment options address some of the manifestations of DCP. The study population will include pediatric and adolescent participants (6 through 18 years of age) with DCP with predominant choreiform movement disorder, who have had nonprogressive CP symptoms since infancy (≤2 years of age). Diagnosis of DCP is based on the Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe criteria.\n\nThis is a Phase 3 study that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of TEV-50717 administered as oral tablets at a starting dose of 6 mg once daily in participants (age 6 through 18 years, inclusive) with DCP with predominant choreiform movement disorder. The study will be conducted in multiple centers and will use 2 parallel treatment groups (ie, TEV-50717 and placebo) in which participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio.\n\n\"Predominant\" in this instance indicates that the choreiform movement disorder is the main cause of impairment or distress."

          "The purpose of the study is to determine the recommended dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab (immunotherapy drugs) in pediatric patients with advanced solid and hematological cancers and expand in a second phase to test the efficacy of these drugs once this dose is determined."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "This is a first time in pediatrics study primarily designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of durvalumab and durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab at increasing doses in pediatric patients with advanced solid malignancies and hematological malignancies (including lymphomas) and for whom no standard of care treatments exist. Although treatment efficacy is not a primary objective of this study given its early phase nature, the patients screened for this study have no curative options and this study offers the potential of some benefit.\n\nThe study will also characterize the PK of durvalumab and durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab in children and adolescents and explore potential biological activity and immunogenicity by assessing pharmacodynamics, anti drug antibody (ADA) levels, and anti-tumor activity. The results from this trial will form the basis for decisions for potential future pediatric studies."

        "BriefSummary": [
          "The specific aims of this study are (1) to determine the clinical phenotypes and natural history of hepatic RC and FAO disorders, (2) to determine the correlation between genotype and phenotype, (3) to determine if circulating biomarkers reflect diagnosis and predict liver disease progression and survival with the native liver, (4) to determine the clinical outcome of these disorders following liver transplantation, and (5) to develop a repository of serum, plasma, urine, tissue and DNA specimens that will be used in ancillary studies. To accomplish these aims, the ChiLDREN investigators at clinical sites (currently 15 sites) will prospectively collect defined data and specimens in a uniform fashion at fixed intervals in a relatively large number of subjects. Clinical information and DNA samples to be collected from subjects and their parents will enhance the potential for meaningful research in these disorders. A biobank of subject specimens and DNA samples will be established for use in ancillary studies to be performed in addition to this study."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "This study will be conducted as part of the NIH-supported Childhood Liver Disease Research and Education Network (ChiLDREN). ChiLDREN is investigating rare cholestatic liver diseases of childhood: alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1AT), Alagille's Syndrome (AGS), progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), bile acid synthesis defects and mitochondrial hepatopathies (all previously studied by the Cholestatic Liver Disease Consortium [CLiC]); biliary atresia (previously studied by the Biliary Atresia Research Consortium [BARC]); neonatal hepatitis; and cystic fibrosis liver disease, which is studied by a new branch of ChiLDREN known as the Cystic Fibrosis Liver Disease (CFLD) Network.\n\nIn this protocol, mitochondrial hepatopathies in children and young adults will be investigated. The focus will be on respiratory chain defects (RC) and defects of fatty acid oxidation (FAO). There is little known about the full spectrum of severity and long-term natural history of mitochondrial hepatopathies. Moreover, these disorders have not been subject to prospective, rigorous clinicopathological scrutiny."

          "Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease is a childhood hip disorder which is common enough to be a significant public health problem (affects 1 in 740 boys between ages 0-14), but uncommon enough to have a sufficient number of patients from a single institution to perform a definitive prospective study comparing the results of current treatments. The present study will establish a database of prospectively identified patients with Legg-Calvé-Perthes (LCP) Disease and collect information regarding their presentation, treatment, and outcomes in the course of receiving currently available treatments.\n\nThis study seeks to compare the outcomes of current treatments in the management of different age groups (ages 1-6, 6-8, 8-11, >11) of patients with Perthes disease at two- and five-year followup and at skeletal maturity. For each age group, two to three common treatment regimens currently used by practicing pediatric orthopaedic surgeons will be compared. The intervention a patient receives is determined through physician preference. Physicians pick an intervention for each age group and treat each patient with the same intervention."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Approximately 50 pediatric orthopaedic surgeons from pediatric centers in the US and other countries have agreed to participate in this database as members of the International Perthes Study Group (IPSG). TSRH will be the lead center. Those who agree to participate will seek IRB approval from their own institutions. Data will be collected prospectively and entered into REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a browser-based research database. Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) questionnaires will be completed via an online testing system, the NIH funded Assessment Center.\n\n1-6 Cohort: For the 1-6 age patient group, patients presenting in an early stage of the disease (stage I or IIa), the surgeons who treat patients with one of the following treatment regimens currently used in practice will be asked to participate in the study.\n\nNon-operative management (i.e., no osteotomy but can include soft tissue release)\nOperative containment treatment (femoral or pelvic osteotomy or Shelf acetabuloplasty).\n\n6-8 Cohort: For the 6-8 age patient group, patients presenting in an early stage of the disease (stage I or IIa), the surgeons who treat their patients with one of the following three treatment regimens currently used in practice will be asked to participate in the study 2-4.\n\nNon-operative management (i.e., no osteotomy but can include soft tissue release);\nOperative containment treatment (femoral or pelvic osteotomy or Shelf acetabuloplasty).\n\n8-11 Cohort:\n\nFor the 8-11 patient age group, patients presenting in an early stage of the disease (stage I or IIa), the surgeons who treat their patients with one of the following treatment regiments currently used in practice will be asked to participate in the study:\n\nNon-operative management (i.e., no osteotomy);\nOperative containment treatment (femoral or pelvic osteotomy or Shelf acetabuloplasty) followed by 6 weeks of postoperative non-weight bearing; and,\nOperative containment treatment (femoral or pelvic osteotomy or Shelf acetabuloplasty) followed by 6 months of postoperative non-weight bearing.\n\n>11 Cohort Registry:\n\nFor the >11 patient age group, patients presenting in an early stage of the disease (stage I or IIa) we will collect prospective data from surgeons who are currently treating their patients with one of the following alternative treatment regimens 5,6:\n\nNon-operative management (i.e. no osteotomy);\nCore decompression or multiple epiphyseal drilling of the necrotic femoral head with post-operative non-weight bearing; or,\nCore decompression or multiple epiphyseal drilling of the necrotic femoral head with application of hinged hip distractor.\n\nPatients who present to an IPSG member or their group during the late stages of the disease (stage IIb or stage III) will also be arranged into four separate age cohorts, identical to the list above. We will collect prospective data from surgeons who are currently treating these patients with operative or non-operative treatment regimens.\n\nRegardless of the patient's stage at enrollment, the patient's age at diagnosis or assigned cohort, the following data will be collected: information regarding patient characteristics at presentation, physical exam findings, responses to Perthes patient and/or outcomes questionnaires, and results of radiographic and MR imaging. Participants will be assigned a unique study number. A secure web application, REDCap, will be used to capture and store research information including de-identified radiographic and MR images, clinical information, and Perthes patient and/or outcomes questionnaire responses.\n\nAll patients willing to complete the PROMIS questionnaires will do so regardless of group, treatment, or stage of the disease. The administration of the instrument is facilitated by the use of an online testing platform, the NIH-funded Assessment Center. Data will be transmitted and stored on a secure and dedicated server for the purpose of this study."

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Juvenile-onset fibromyalgia (JFM) is a chronic, debilitating pain condition that typically persists into adulthood for the majority of patients. Whereas medications offer limited and short-term symptom relief for JFM, our research group has demonstrated that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is safe, effective and durable in reducing functional disability and depressive symptoms in adolescents with this condition. However, 60% of patients receiving CBT did not show clinically significant improvement in functional disability, and pain levels remained in the moderate range despite being reduced overall. Our multidisciplinary team of experts in Behavioral Medicine, Rheumatology and Exercise Science has developed and tested the feasibility of a new Fibromyalgia Integrative Training program for Teens (FIT Teens), which enhances the established CBT intervention with a novel neuromuscular exercise training program derived from evidence-based pediatric injury prevention research. Pilot testing showed excellent patient engagement, no adverse effects and very promising early results indicating this treatment to have even stronger effects on disability and pain outcomes than CBT alone. This trial evaluates whether the FIT Teens intervention is more effective than CBT alone or graded aerobic exercise alone and whether treatment effects are sustainable over 1 year follow-up."

          "Previous clinical trials in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have demonstrated that ventilator management choices can improve Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality and shorten time on mechanical ventilation. This study seeks to scale an established Clinical Decision Support (CDS) tool to facilitate dissemination and implementation of evidence-based research in mechanical ventilation of infants and children with pediatric ARDS (PARDS).\n\nThis will be accomplished by using CDS tools developed and deployed in Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) which are based on the best available pediatric evidence, and are currently being used in an NHLBI funded single center randomized controlled trial (NCT03266016, PI: Khemani). Without CDS, there is significant variability in ventilator management of PARDS patients both between and within Pediatric ICUs (PICUs), but clinicians are willing to accept CDS recommendations. The CDS tool will be deployed in multiple PICUs, targeting enrollment of up to 180 children with PARDS. Study hypotheses:\n\nThe CDS tool in will be implementable in nearly all participating sites\nThere will be > 80% compliance with CDS recommendations and\nThe investigators can implement automatic data capture and entry in many of the ICUs\n\nOnce feasibility of this CDS tool is demonstrated, a multi-center validation study will be designed, which seeks to determine whether the CDS can result in a significant reduction in length of mechanical ventilation (LMV)."
        ],
        "DetailedDescription": [
          "The central hypothesis is that CDS will help standardize ventilator management consistent with evidence-based recommendations leading to shorter LMV by limiting VILI (Ventilator Induced Lung Injury), preventing VIDD (Ventilator Induced Diaphragm Dysfunction) and allowing earlier recognition that patients are ready for liberation from the ventilator. However, key questions must be addressed prior to wide dissemination of this CDS tool:\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To assess the feasibility of implementing a web-based, de-identified CDS tool for MV in pediatric ARDS in multiple PICUs. Hypothesis: this CDS tool will be implementable in all PICUs to function consistent with each hospital's specific Information Technology (IT) capabilities.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To assess the acceptability and compliance with recommendations from the CDS tool related to oxygenation, ventilation, weaning and extubation readiness testing in PARDS patients at each of the participating PICUs (anticipated 20 patients enrolled per site). Hypothesis: over time, adherence with recommendations in each of these domains will exceed 80% in all PICUs.\n\nSpecific Aim 3: To implement methods for automated data capture within CDS to provide the right information, to the right person, using the right format, in the right channel and at the right time during workflow (\"CDS Five Rights\") framework, which can be adapted to the individual IT capabilities at each hospital. Hypothesis: Over 90% of necessary data can be pulled into the CDS in an automated fashion in sites which have access to electronic data capture of ventilator settings and blood gases.\n\nPatients will be managed on the eVentilator protocol (the CDS tool), through the acute, stable and weaning phases of mechanical ventilation, including Spontaneous Breathing tests (SBTs) and Extubation Readiness tests.\n\nData will be qualitatively assessed for implementation barriers. Acceptance and rejection and mode stratification will be examined. Data needed for the CDS protocol will be available electronically or can be interfaced through the bedside monitor.\n\nPatients will be on the CDS protocol, as intent to treat, while patient is on invasive mechanical ventilation, capped at 28 days, limitation of care, or death, whichever comes first."

          "Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are among the most bothersome symptoms during cancer treatment according to children and their parents. Most children receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) conditioning experience CINV despite receiving antiemetic prophylaxis. Olanzapine improves CINV control in adult cancer patients, has a track record of safe use in children with psychiatric illness, does not interact with chemotherapy and is inexpensive. We hypothesize that the addition of olanzapine to standard antiemetics will improve chemotherapy-induced vomiting (CIV) control in children receiving chemotherapy for HSCT conditioning."

          "This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, PK, safety and tolerability study of oritavancin in pediatric patients (<18 years of age) with suspected or diagnosed Gram-positive bacterial infections or pediatric patients requiring peri-operative prophylactic antibiotics. Approximately 52 patients will be enrolled at 5-10 US centers. This study will include 5 age cohorts and patients will be entered in a stepwise approach starting with the older age cohort (12-<18 years). The starting dose will be IV oritavancin 15 mg/kg. The safety, tolerability and PK data will be reviewed at the completion of each cohort to ensure safety and determine the appropriate dose for the next age cohort. At least 8 patients will be enrolled in each cohort except for the birth to <3 month age cohort which will have at least 16 patients enrolled. Three PK samples will be collected over 14 days. The safety follow-up will complete with a 60-day phone call to the caregiver."

          "This is a Phase 2/3, long term, open-label, follow-up study. Subjects will have previously participated in qualifying/index JIA studies of tofacitinib. Those who have already completed such participation and enroll outside the 14 day window following completion of the End of Study (EOS) Visit of the qualifying/index study will participate in a screening Visit to determine eligibility. A Baseline Visit will then occur within 28 days after the Screening Visit. For subjects who are completing participation in a qualifying study of tofacitinib and enrolling on the same day of the EOS Visit of the qualifying/index study, the EOS Visit of the qualifying/index study can be combined with the Screening and Baseline Visits for this study. The subjects who enroll within the 14 day window following completion of the EOS Visit of the qualifying/index study will participate in a combined Screening and Baseline Visit for this study. After the Baseline Visit, visits will occur at 1 month (1 month=30 days) and 3 months, then every 3 months thereafter as long as the subject remains in the study.\n\nApproximately 340 participants are projected to enroll into this open label extension study after completing a qualifying/index study in the JIA program.\n\nThis study (A3921145) is planned to run until the first global marketing approval of tofacitinib for the treatment of JIA. The total duration of an individual subject's participation may vary depending upon when they enter the trial."

Two consecutive i STAT K+ values, measured 60 (±15) minutes apart, both >5.0 mmol/L and measured within 1 day before the first dose of SZC on CP Study Day 1.\nFor participants <2 years of age, i STAT K+ level >6.0 mmol/L at Screening, measured within 1 day before the first dose of SZC on CP Study Day 1.\n\nNote that if Day 1 is the same as the Screening day, the 60 (±15) minute K+ value is the same as the Day 1 time 0 K+ value. However, if Day 1 is not the same day as Screening, then the participant will actually have 3 i STAT-K+ values measured before starting treatment in the CP and the third value which is taken on Day 1 time 0 must also be hyperkalaemic.\n\nUsing digital ECG, QT interval corrected by Bazett's method (QTcB) must meet the age-appropriate parameters at Screening:\n\nFor participants aged 0 to ≤3 days after birth: <450 ms\nFor participants aged >3 days to <12 years: <440 ms\nFor participants ≥12 to <18 years: <450 ms (male), <460 ms (female) All QTcB values outside the reference values specified in the protocol should be manually re-measured and re-calculated, and if there is a difference in measurement between the automatic and manual ECG, the manual measurement should always be considered correct.\nAbility to have repeated blood draws or effective venous catheterization.\nFemales of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 1 day prior to the first dose of SZC on CP Study Day 1 and sexually active females of childbearing potential must be using 2 forms of medically acceptable contraception with at least 1 being a barrier method\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nNeonates with a gestational age <37 weeks at birth or a birth weight <2500 g.\nTerm and preterm neonates with suspected conditions predisposing them to intestinal ischemia (eg, perinatal hypoxia or sepsis).\nParticipants with pseudohyperkalaemia caused by excessive fist clenching to enable venepuncture, by haemolysed blood specimens, or by severe leukocytosis or thrombocytosis.\nParticipants with hyperkalaemia due to soft-tissue damage from crush injury or burns.\nParticipants with hyperkalaemia due to a secondary cause, such as dehydration, excessive use of K+ supplements, or drug use (eg, beta-adrenergic antagonists) and that would be more appropriately treated with other interventions (eg, fluid resuscitation, dose adjustments of medications).\nParticipants treated with lactulose, rifaximin (XIFAXAN™), or other nonabsorbed antibiotics for hyperammonaemia within the last 7 days.\nParticipants treated with CPS, sodium polystyrene sulfonate (eg, KAYEXALATE™), or patiromer within the last 4 days.\nParticipants with a life expectancy of less than 3 months.\nParticipants who are known to have tested Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive.\nPresence of any condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, places the participant at undue risk or potentially jeopardises the quality of the data to be generated.\nKnown hypersensitivity or previous anaphylaxis to SZC or to components thereof.\nParticipants with cardiac arrhythmias that require immediate treatment.\nParticipants with a family history of long QT syndrome.\nParticipants on haemodialysis.\nParticipants with a history of bowel obstruction.\nParticipants with severe gastrointestinal disorder or major gastrointestinal surgery (eg, large bowel resection).\nInvolvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca staff and/or staff at the study site).\nPrevious treatment with SZC.\nTreatment with a drug or device within the last 30 days that has not received regulatory approval at the time of study entry.\nPrevious enrolment in the present study.\nFemales who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.\nJudgment by the Investigator that the participant should not participate in the study if the participant is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements.\nFor the LTMP only: participants who are normokalaemic at Visit 8b and are receiving placebo at Visit 8a of the MP unless they received rescue treatment.\nIf the participant has evidence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) within 2 weeks prior to enrolment (a positive COVID-19 test or suspicion of COVID-19 infection) the participant cannot be enrolled in the study."

haematology parameters)\nCentral laboratory K+\nPhysical examinations\n\nOverall design:\n\nApproximately 140 participants will be enroled at approximately 40 sites in locations including but not limited to Europe and North America for this study.\n\nTreatment will include 3 phases: the CP, MP, and LTMP. Participants from 2 to <18 years are eligible to participate in all phases of the study. Participants <2 years of age will be included in the first 2 phases, namely the CP and the MP.\n\nDuring the study, participants are recommended to be fasting prior to any visit pre-dose laboratory testing.

Open ended non leading verbal questioning of the participant or participant's legal representative, as appropriate, is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences.\n\nParticipants are allowed to discontinue the study treatment and assessments at any time or at the discretion of the Investigator(s). Participants and their legal representatives are also free to withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice to further treatment. Participants who discontinue study treatment for any reason during MP or LTMP will be followed up and are encouraged to continue to be monitored according to the protocol schedule.\n\nThe independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will monitor data during all phases of the study including DL evaluations.\n\nStudy period:\n\nEstimated date of first participant enrolled Q4 2018 Estimated date of last participant completed Q4 2023\n\nNumber of participants:\n\nThe study will enrol approximately 140 participants into the CP in order to achieve randomisation of at least 90 participants into the MP. Of the 140 participants enrolled, ≥5 participants should be in the birth to <2 years cohort. Additionally, the 90 (or greater) participants randomised into the MP should include ≥30 participants in the 12 to <18 years cohort, ≥30 participants in the 6 to <12 years cohort, and ≥10 participants in the 2 to <6 years cohort. At least 45 participants randomised in the MP should have a Screening i-STAT-K+ level (using the mean of the 2 consecutive i-STAT-K+ measurements at Screening) of >5.5 mmol/L. A minimum number of 75 participants must continue study treatment throughout the MP (≥25 participants in the 12 to <18 years cohort, ≥25 participants in the 6 to <12 years cohort, and ≥8 participants in the 2 to <6 years cohort). Hence, randomisation in the MP will continue until it can be predicted that at least 75 participants fulfilling the specific age cohort requirements will complete the MP without premature discontinuation of study treatment.\n\nBased on data from adult study SZC-004, the proportion of responders (participant with maintained normokalaemia throughout the MP) can be assumed to be 37% and 12% in the SZC and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Forty-five participants per group will then provide 79% power using a chi-square test at 5% significance level.\n\nTreatments and treatment duration:\n\nTreatment will include 3 phases: the CP, MP, and LTMP. Participants from 2 to <18 years requiring chronic treatment for hyperkalaemia are eligible to participate in all phases of the study if entry criteria are met. Participants <2 years of age requiring acute or chronic treatment for hyperkalaemia will be included in the first 2 phases, namely the CP and the MP. The 3 treatment phases are specified below:\n\nAn open-label CP during which SZC is administered orally 3 times daily (TID) prior to breakfast, midday, and evening for 1 to 3 days to achieve normokalaemia in participants from birth to <18 years.\nA 28-day MP during which SZC or placebo is administered in a randomised, double-blind manner orally once daily (QD) to maintain normokalaemia in participants from 2 to <18 years. Participants aged <2 years will continue treatment in the MP with open-label QD oral SZC active treatment if medically indicated by the treating physician. In cohorts 2 to <18 years, at the end of the MP (Visit 8a), the Investigator will unblind the MP treatment to determine eligibility for the LTMP.\nAn open-label LTMP during which SZC is administered QD for up to 22 weeks for participants aged 2 to <18 years who either maintain normokalaemia on active drug during the MP or are hyperkalaemic on active drug or placebo during the MP. Continuation into this phase is optional and will be determined by the Investigator based on the participant's need for long term treatment. Dose titration for individual participants will only be an option in this phase after data is evaluated by the iDMC and the next DL is opened.\n\nDose levels are derived from doses of SZC previously used in the adult population, by adjusting for paediatric body weight.\n\nData Monitoring Committee:\n\nAn iDMC will be utilised for this study to evaluate emerging safety data during all phases of the study in addition to DL evaluations.\n\nStatistical methods All efficacy analyses will be based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) principle using the Full analysis set.\n\nSafety analyses will similarly be primarily based on the ITT principle of including data after premature discontinuation of study treatment using the Safety analysis set.\n\nIn general, CP data will be presented by dose. Maintenance phase data will be presented by treatment, denoted by SZC or placebo.\n\nIn the LTMP, the open-label SZC dose can be titrated. Summaries by dose will however be done based on the dose the participant was initially on when starting the LTMP.\n\nNo interim analyses are planned for this study."

As such this study is a Phase I/Ib study of combined 5'Azacitidine with an escalating dose of carboplatin for all recurrent/refractory pediatric brain and solid tumors.

        "DetailedDescription": [
          "Aberrant DNA methylation is frequently observed in many pediatric solid tumors, but in particularly several entities such as ependymoma, medulloblastoma, embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes, atypical/teratoid rhabdoid tumor, neuroblastoma and wilm's tumor have promoter hypermethylation. Treatment with DNMTi (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors) agents such as 5-azacytidine has been shown to be safe and efficacious in adult myelodysplastic syndromes, causing significant decreased DNA methylation in blood, with maximum effect at day 15 of each cycle. However, monotherapy with DNMTi has been shown to result in resistance in leukamia's and efficacy in solid tumours is limited. Synergy between DNMTi and platinum agents has shown promise in pre-clinical models including pediatric ependymoma, and in addition, the combination of demethylating agents with carboplatin has provided promising results in platinum resistant ovarian cancers. However, this approach has not been applied to pediatric solid malignancies, which are attractive targets due to their frequent epigenetic dysregulation.\n\nPlatinums are the backbone of therapy for most pediatric solid tumors, and as such it is an attractive hypothesis that part of the reason for resistance to upfront therapies is platinum resistance. Specifically, ependymoma's are highly chemoresistant tumors and studies in preclinical models of ependymoma support that this chemoresistance can be overcome with DNMTi.\n\nThere is a clear medical need for new therapies, particularly for relapsed solid tumors, specifically brain tumors. Although pre-clinical data from our group and others suggests DNA demethylase inhibitors to be promising therapies for high risk ependymoma, medulloblastoma and ETMR (embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes), 5'azacitidine monotherapy has been disappointing in clinical studies of adult solid tumours. Previous studies have suggested that platinum therapy can be effectively combined with azacitidine therapy and based on adult studies, maximum demethylation occurs approximately 5-10 days after treatment with 5'azacitidine. As such combination of azacitidine and carboplatin is a rationale therapy for several pediatric brain tumours, particularly those with a hypermethylated phenotype.\n\nTwo phases of the study will be conducted. The Phase I will establish the maximum tolerated dose of carboplatin and 5'azacytidine in a rolling 6 design. 5'azacytidine will be administered on Days 1-7 followed by Carboplatin on Day 15. The initial dose level will be 5'Azacytidine 75mg/m2/day for 7 days with Carboplatin administered on Day 15 at AUC (Area under curve) 4. Carboplatin will be dose escalated to a maximum of AUC 6, or de-escalated to AUC 3. The Phase Ib will be an ependymoma specific expansion cohort at the established MTD (maximum tolerated dose), to determine the feasibility and initial efficacy of the combination of carboplatin and 5'azacytidine in patients with recurrent/refractory posterior fossa and supratentorial ependymoma."

          "Vedolizumab (VDZ) is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody acting against α4β7 integrin which modulates lymphocyte trafficking in the gut.\n\nResults from the adult GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 trials demonstrated clinical efficacy in induction and maintenance of remission in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), respectively.\n\nRecent real life cohorts in adults support the effectiveness of VDZ in inducing and maintaining remission, both in CD and UC. In pediatrics, there are very limited data on the use of VDZ besides two retrospective case series.\n\nData on immunogenicity and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of VDZ is conflicting in adults and practically non-existent in children.\n\nThe investigators aim to prospectively explore the real life short and longer term outcomes of VDZ in pediatric IBD (including growth) and to develop a prediction model for treatment success based on VDZ trough levels and other clinical and laboratory variables."
